Currently, Renner is the senior pastor of the Moscow Good News Church.</b></p><p>Rick is also the founder of Rick Renner Ministries and Media Mir which is a media outreach in the former USSR. Renner also works as the host of his TV program seen around the world. He fills a unique position in the modern Christian world, combining an extraordinary depth of scriptural and practical knowledge with an easy-to-understand, faith-filled approach to the Bible.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=10-facts-about-rick-renner></span><span>10 Facts About Rick Renner</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li><strong>Name: </strong>Rick Renner</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>Under review</li><li><strong>Birthday:</strong> Under review</li><li><strong>Height: </strong>Under review</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>Under review</li><li><strong>Nationality: </strong>American</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married to Denise Renner</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Author</li><li><strong>Salary: </strong>Under review</li><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong>$1 to $10 Million dollars</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-age></span><span>Rick Renner Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b data-stringify-type=bold>Rick’s age, date of birth, and birthday are publicly not available. </b>We will update this section once this information is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-height></span><span>Rick Renner Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Rick stands at an average height.</strong> He appears to be quite tall in stature of his photos, relative to his surroundings, which are anything to go by. However, details regarding his actual height and other body measurements are currently not publicly available. We will update this section when the information is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-education></span><span>Rick Renner Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rick studied Journalism and Greek while also growing in his&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;ministry.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-family></span><span>Rick Renner Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Rick was born and raised by his parents in the United States</strong>. Our efforts to find out more about his <strong>family</strong>&nbsp;came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of&nbsp;<strong>Rick’s parents</strong> is still unclear. It is also not known if he has any siblings.</p><p>However, Rick remembers that when he was a young boy, each night his family gathered around the table in the dining room for the evening meal. His mother cooked while he set the plates with his sisters and silverware on the table, and before they ate, his father prayed a prayer of blessing over our meal.</p><p>He remembers how wonderful family time it was such that they looked forward to each evening. When they finished their meal, they washed, dried, and put away the dishes. Then they would usually move to the living room to spend time together watching a couple of family-oriented TV programs.</p><p>He keeps on adding that they ate together, prayed together, spent our evenings and weekends together, went to church together, and even rode everywhere in the car together because we only had one car.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-wife></span><span>Rick Renner Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Rick is married to his lovely wife Denise Renner in 1981.</strong> The two met while they were each on an individual quest to wholeheartedly follow God’s plan for their lives. Rick was a college student, growing in his teaching ministry. Denise was a talented vocalist.</p><p>She chose not to pursue a course that held the prospect of performing with the Metropolitan Opera so that she could instead pursue a relationship with Rick and fulfill her heart’s desire to enter full-time ministry.&nbsp;He resides in Moscow with his wife Denise and their three sons and families.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-net-worth></span><span>Rick Renner Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b data-stringify-type=bold>Rick’s net worth is publicly not available</b>. His primary source of income is his career as an author and minister.

Also, Rick is the founder of Media Mir, the first Christian television network established in the former USSR. The network now broadcasts the Gospel to a potential audience of 110 million people. Today the Moscow Good News Church is one of the largest Protestant churches in the city of Moscow, with several thousand people in active attendance.</p><p>Over the years, Rick and Denise pioneered three churches, a Bible school, and a ministerial association that serves thousands of Russian-speaking pastors throughout the former USSR as well as parts of the Middle East. As Rick began training and mentoring leaders in the early days, Denise also developed a women’s ministry that is actively involved in changing the lives of women and their families today. Specifically, they minister to the needs of orphans, women prisoners, the homeless, and drug-and-alcohol addicts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-work></span><span>Rick Renner Work</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The vision of Rick Renner Ministries is to do its part in helping to bring every person to maturity in Christ. To this end, Rick Renner founded both a seminary and a ministerial association. The ministry translates and publishes many books in the Russian language from its Good News Distribution Department.&nbsp; Through the years, literally tons of books have been delivered free of charge to people in that region of the world. This was so that the word could help them grow in their relationship with God. Also, Rick Renner Ministries is also involved in various aspects of social evangelism in Moscow, using innovative methods to reach different age groups of people — such as children and their parents, teenagers, and the elderly — whose needs have largely gone unmet by society.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rick-renner-books></span><span>Rick Renner Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>2019</strong> The Will of God, the Key to Your Success: Positioning Yourself to Live in God’s Supernatural Power, Provision, and Protection</li><li><strong>2019</strong> How to Keep Your Head on Straight in a World Gone Crazy: Developing Discernment for These Last Days</li><li><strong>2018</strong> Life in the Combat Zone: How to Survive, Thrive, and Overcome in the Midst of Difficult Situations</li></ul><ul><li><strong>2018</strong> Why We Need the Gifts of the Holy Spirit</li><li><strong>2018</strong> Signs You Will See Just Before Jesus Comes</li><li><strong>2017</strong> A Light in Darkness Volume 1: Seven Messages to the Seven Churches</li></ul><ul><li><strong>2017</strong> Sparkling Gems from the Greek: 365 New Gems to Equip and Empower You for Victory Every Day of the Year</li><li><strong>2017</strong> How to Receive Answers From Heaven: What to Do When Your Prayers Go Unanswered</li><li><strong>2017</strong> Repentance: What It Is, What It Isn’t, and How to Do It</li></ul><ul><li><strong>2014</strong> Say Yes!

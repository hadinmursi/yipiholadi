That's what took place a year ago when <strong><a href=#>Nick Cannon</a></strong> appeared on The <strong><a href=#>Howard Stern</a></strong> Show. The two had a couple of hot topics, and one of them was unexpected, none other than Taylor Swift. Although Nick Cannon was trying to be funny, fans were enraged following the conversation.</p><p>In the following, we're going to take a look back at what Cannon had to say about Swift, and possibly dating her given Taylor's single status at the time. In addition, we'll reveal what else Cannon had to say, and his thoughts on having more children in the future.</p><p>Let's take a closer look.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-04t154154-287.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Alanis Morissette Admitted To Howard Stern Her Experience With Taylor Swift Was The Opposite Of What She Expected</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Alanis Morissette told Howard Stern she realized the times had changed following her work alongside Taylor Swift.</span><h2 id=nick-cannon-joked-with-howard-stern-that-he-should-date-taylor-swift-due-to-everything-they-have-in-common>Nick Cannon Joked With Howard Stern That He Should Date Taylor Swift Due To Everything They Have In Common</h2><p>As expected at the time of their interview a year ago, Nick Cannon was asked about his 12 children, and if he had plans for other kids in the future. At that point, Nick Cannon stated that he was finally ready to settle down, and be a positive role model to his children. Of course, Howard Stern continued to poke, and asked if he would consider having children if Taylor Swift came along. The artist was single during that time period.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is where fans were angry with Nick Cannon, who suggested he and Swift have a lot in common, and could make a relationship work. Of course, he was joking to a degree. But still, it wasn't enough for fans to cool off.</p><p>“Me and Taylor’s numbers are very similar when we’re talking about being in these streets. So, I think she would relate to me very well,” Cannon concluded. “We probably would really understand each other.”</p><p>He continues, “My Spidey-Sense is tingling,” Nick laughed. “I think that would be amazing.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-interview.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Are Convinced Travis Kelce's Latest Interview Was Recorded From Taylor Swift's House</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce was speaking with the interviewer over Zoom, and the background of the video call became instantly recognizable for swifties.</span><p>On a more serious note, before answering the question, Cannon brought up how his priorities regarding kids had changed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Every time I answer this question – I can never answer it correctly because I don’t know. I’m happy currently with the [children] that I got."</p><p>Once the interview came to an end, the Swifites were commenting full force, going after Cannon for his comments.</p><h2 id=fans-were-consistent-with-their-interview-response-telling-nick-cannon-to-stay-away-from-taylor-swift>Fans Were Consistent With Their Interview Response, Telling Nick Cannon To Stay Away From Taylor Swift</h2><p>Oh yes, Cannon took some heat for this one. For the most part, fans were advising Swift to stay away from Cannon. Fans wrote, "Taylor’s numbers are NOT similar to HIM." Another fan comments, "No please leave Taylor Swift alone."</p><p>The most liked comment of the clip points at Nick Cannon's early fame for the reason he appears to have problems with mental health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You know how a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon stars have problems with mental illness? I think Nick Cannon has fallen under the radar. Promiscuity is seen as a symptom in SA. But, promiscuity is really only seen as a problem in females and some see it as symbol of success in males, but I think that's what is going on with Nick Cannon, tbh."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-8-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Howard Stern Slams His Experience At Sean 'Diddy' Combs' House Parties Amid The Horrendous Allegations</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Howard Stern had a horrible time at Sean 'Diddy' Combs house party before allegations were leveled against him.</span><p>At the age of 43, it should be known that Cannon held true to his word following the interview alongside Howard Stern. The TV personality is still at 12 kids total at the moment and that number has not increased in the last year. As for Taylor Swift, well she moved on in a different direction, forming a relationship with NFL star, <strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a></strong>.</p><h2 id=nick-cannon-also-told-howard-stern-his-attempt-at-celibacy-only-made-things-worse>Nick Cannon Also Told Howard Stern His Attempt At Celibacy Only Made Things Worse</h2><p>Nick Cannon also discussed his struggles from the past, and how he attempted not to have children by drastic measures. Cannon revealed he was given advice by a therapist to be celibate. Nick admits this only made things worse in the long run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar51019065-1.jpg><p>“It’s a healthy balance … one therapist told me I should be celibate — that didn’t work, I had like more kids after that.”</p><p>“People were saying I was sleep-f******,” he revealed. “People would see me, and I’d be, like, gyrating … I guess I was having some dreams.”</p><p>Cannon continued on, stating this focus was specifically on his children. “I’m not out there like that,” he explained. “I’m really trying to focus on myself and my children … my bandwidth doesn’t even allow me to kind of be in that space.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continues, "It sounds wild, but my main focus is either my children or work."

In fact, James Taylor told Guitar Player magazine that Douglas is “the Muhammad Ali of the Dobro.”</p><p>With friends like that, it’s no wonder that a whole lot of other friends would hop on board Jerry’s latest album, Traveler, lending vocal and instrumental support to the 11-song collection that’s due for release on eOne Music on June 26.</p><p>The liner notes for Traveler, the follow-up to his 2009 holiday collection, Merry Christmas!, read like a who’s who of popular American music, with guest vocals from Eric Clapton, Marc Cohn, Keb’ Mo’, Alison Krauss and Union Station, Mumford & Sons and Paul Simon. Also along for the ride: Sam Bush (harmony vocals and mandolin), Dr. John (piano), Béla Fleck (banjo), Omar Hakim (drums), Viktor Krauss (bass), and Del McCoury (harmony vocals), among others.</p><p>“This record is the culmination of a long career spent making friends and lending my sound to theirs,” says the three-time CMA and 11-time ACM Musician of the Year. “This time my friends have come on board to lend their voices to me.”</p><p>Recorded in Nashville, New Orleans, New York, and Banbury, U.K., the album spotlights versions of Paul Simon’s classics “The Boxer” and “American Tune.”</p><p>In addition to four original instrumental tunes from Jerry, he also offers up his first solo lead vocal on record for a rendition of Leadbelly’s “On a Monday,” (a prison tune Johnny Cash later reworked as “I Got Stripes”).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jerry-douglas-traveler-track-listing></span>Jerry Douglas, Traveler track listing:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>“On a Monday”</li><li>“Something You Got” (feat.

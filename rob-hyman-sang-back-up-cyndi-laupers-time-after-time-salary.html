She may be known for the faster-paced single "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun," but her ballad has become a memorable part of pop culture. In 2020, <a href=#>Sam Smith sang a cover of "Time After Time,"</a> and it was fun to hear Smith's rendition of it.</p><p>Cyndi Lauper has been a vibrant part of the <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>industry ever since her debut album "She's So Unusual" was released in 1983. Rob Hyman, a songwriter who is part of the band The Hooters, also sang on "Time After Time."

That collaboration led to the unique and special song "Time After Time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyndi-lauper.jpg><p>While exact figures aren't available, fans can guess that Rob Hyman has made good money from "Time After Time." He not only sang on the tune, but he also co-wrote it alongside Lauper.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Failed To Recognize Her Own Song During An Interview On The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon</a></span></p><p>Songwriters earn cash through royalties and Rolling Stone reported on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">royalties for some hit songs</a>. Rolling Stone explained, "Every time a track or record sells, all the songwriters receive a total of 9.1 cents in mechanical-royalty payments." Of course, these numbers vary quite a bit. For some artists, though, they can make millions of dollars in royalties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rob-hyman.jpg><p>According to Rolling Stone, Mark Foster, who wrote the popular Foster The People song "Pumped Up Kicks," made $406,861 due to royalties.</p><p>The publication gave the example of the Whitney Houston song "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love And Misunderstanding." According to Rolling Stone, the songwriter, Nick Lowe, made $1.547 million because 17 million copies of the song had been purchased.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Even Jimmy Buffett Never Expected He Would Turn A Single Song Into Billion-Dollar Franchise</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks starting on June 9th, 1984. This suggests that it was incredibly popular at the time and that both Lauper and Hyman earned money from the track. Since they co-wrote it, it's possible to assume that they have split the songwriting royalties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/romy-michelles-high-school-reunion.jpg><p>There's also the fact that "Time After Time" was in the 1997 movie Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow co-starred as Romy White and Michelle Weinberger, close friends who want to get revenge on everyone who made fun of them when they were teenagers. The characters dance to "Time After Time" at the reunion, which has become the most well-known moment in the entire film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems likely that Cyndi Lauper and Rob Hyman earned money from this. According to ascap.com, a movie producer will talk to the music publisher and get the rights to the tune. The producer then needs "a synchronization or broad rights license" and they will also pay in order to use the song. The music publisher then makes sure that the writer of the song gets some money, which is called the "synchronization fee."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyndi-lauper-2.jpg><p>While Rob Hyman's net worth is unknown, there's no doubt that he and Lauper both became very comfortable thanks to the success of "Time After Time." It must be incredibly satisfying for artists to pour everything into a song and then see it take off like this one did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-cyndi-lauper-and-rob-hyman-39-s-song-quot-time-after-time-quot-about>What Is Cyndi Lauper And Rob Hyman's Song "Time After Time" About?</h2><p>There's no doubt that many people have listened to "Time After Time" and been able to relate at least once. It's a moving song about heartbreak and still caring a lot about someone, even though the days keep marching on. The lyrics are poetic and they have real staying power.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The One Sting Song That Made More Than $20.5 Million In Royalties Alone</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Hyman talked about "Time After Time"</a> in an interview with Songfacts.com. He described the song as "a little more bittersweet and a little deeper in its feeling and a little more poignant."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyndi-lauper-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyman said of Lauper, "We talked and right from the jump she was so unusual. She was definitely different and striking and creative. One thing led to another - she saw our band, we got a chance to hear one of her demos. She came down to Philadelphia and was staying with a friend. She worked with us in our rehearsal studio and did a bunch of demos, so it was really a tryout period - we also tried out some drummers and bass players, but it ended up being Eric and myself doing most of the guitars and keyboards, and Rick producing. We became her band for that album."</p><p>Hyman also explained in his interview with Songfacts.com that they were vulnerable with one another since they didn't know each other super well when they penned the tune together. It sounds like it was a wonderful artistic experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cyndi-lauper-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said of writing "Time After Time," "It's almost one of those things where you can open up to a stranger or a more casual acquaintance than a deep friend or family member. Sometimes you meet someone at a party and you start saying things about yourself that you might not say to your closest friend. I think with the things we were both going through - for me it was a relationship that was just breaking up and for Cyndi with her manager, which was also a personal relationship - I think the song reflected that mood."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rob-hyman-sang-back-up-in-cyndi-lauper-s-_time-after-time_-but-did-he-actually-make-any-money_.jpg><p>Rob Hyman and Cyndi Lauper seemed to love working on "Time After Time" together, and it was great for both of their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hyman received a Song Of The Year Grammy nomination in 1985. While "Time After Time" didn't win, this is proof that people have loved this song for several decades now.

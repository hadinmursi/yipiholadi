When it comes to finding love in Turks and Caicos, it appears as if Emily Miller and Cam Holmes had no problem doing just that.</p><p>As Emily and Cam navigate the first few months as a couple sans the cameras, it seems as if they are already dealing with some unwanted drama.</p><p>During an exclusive interview with TheThings, <strong>Cam Holmes revealed that his friendship with fellow co-star, Chase DeMoor, is a little rocky!</strong></p><p>When asked if there was any behind-the-scenes drama following the end of season two, Cam shared that Chase had been making some rather confusing claims on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> regarding his time on Too Hot To Handle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Chase went on to allude to having had a fling with Emily during the filming of the show</strong>, despite none of that transpiring on-screen, and Cam and Emily were just as confused as the rest of us.</p><p>"Chase, for some reason started making up these strange TikToks about the fact that he and Em were a thing," Cam said. "We sat there confused!" Same, Cam, same!</p><p>"So confused," Emily agreed. "This was before we had announced to the world that we were still together, and he was trying to get the clout that me and Chase were together and it was so bizarre," she said.</p><p>Well, this didn't sit well with Cam, who made it clear he wasn't about any type of that nonsense, <strong>prompting him to unfollow Chase on social media</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Cam unfollowed Chase on Instagram," Emily shared. "Yeah, I unfollowed him.

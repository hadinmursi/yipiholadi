Michael Woodard who had been noted for playing piano trailed by poignant songs by a minority of audience, gripped national attention when performed ‘Make it Rain’ by Ed Sheeran on American Idol auditions. He literally wowed all three judges as well as a whole audience of Idol with exceptional and eccentric voice.</p><p><strong>Quick Info:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Birthday:</strong>&nbsp;1997 (Age 20)</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong>&nbsp;Afro-American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong>&nbsp;American</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong>&nbsp;Bowling alley attendant, singer</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=salary-and-net-worth-2018></span>Salary and Net Worth 2018<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Woodard estimated net worth and salary are yet to be counted. However, considering the fact that he was the winner of music reality show ‘Majors and Minors’, which earned him a recording deal, he perhaps has hoarded massive amount of fortunes.</p><p>Michael projected net worth and salary is yet to be revealed as hasn’t disclosed the ideal figure to date. An accustomed face in television, he had formerly won the music competition ‘Majors and Minors’ and as per the deal, he bragged a recording contract which most possibly earned him a huge amount. Now moving swiftly towards the trophy of American Idol, he seems to make a magnificent career out of music in American Idol.</p><p><strong>Quick Info:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional-career></span>Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Woodard became a household name with the reboot of American Idol as he won golden ticket. He previously had arisen as a winner of ‘Majors and Minors’ on The Hub Network.</p><p>Though blessed with innate talent and exceptional voice which thrived to become an astounding voice with passing time, his musical prowess and skills were in the shadow until he found himself a platform of American Idol. Walking the door of auditions room leading all the way to judges, he had an edgy start at the beginning, being petrified and nervous.</p><p><strong>Career Timeline:</strong></p><ul><li>2012: Winner of Hub Network reality series’ Majors and Minors’</li><li>2018: Thrived to win the ticket to Hollywood for ABC reality show ‘American Idol’</li></ul><p>The legendary Lionel Richie, however, was kind enough to help him lessen his terror, and soon after that, he picked up the song ‘Make It Rain’ by Ed Sheeran immaculately, never looking back again. The outstanding and raw voice from Michael not only impressed the judges but the global audience resulting which, he received unanimous yesses from Richie, Perry,&nbsp;and Bryan to Hollywood.</p><p>But this was not the first time Michael was crowned victorious as back in 2012, he emerged to be the winner of a reality series ‘Majors and Minors’ on the Hub Television network. Back then, he was 13 but the vocal and control on tone were as commanding and potent, which not merely got him the title but also earned a record deal with Boardwalk Records and RCA Records.</p><p>Being a title holder of the show, he got an opportunity to work with legendary recording artists such as Jennifer Hudson, Brandy, and Evan Bogart, releasing solo ‘Closer’ over a period. Prior to joining the American Idol, he worked as a bowling alley attendant.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=body-measurements-and-lifestyle></span>Body Measurements and Lifestyle<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Woodard is a man with signature goodness, elegance and vivid character. Managed to grip a well-toned and slender body trailed by an attractive look, he is one of the contestants to strictly look for in American Idol.</p><p>Frisky, Jovial, and virtuousness, he has a cordial and scintillating presence wherever appears. With smoldering eyes, drop-dead looks and subtle simplicity, he makes a cryptic man whose voice speaks thousands of untold stories that yanks audience towards him. Michael, a fresh face and a raw talent have the dexterity to mold and rheostat the viewers with a poignant and distinctive voice.</p><p><strong>Quick Info:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Body Measurements:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Plastic Surgery:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li></ul><p>Blessed with sheer soul, he has a trademark elegant character making him the most desirable and standout character of all. Standing at an average height, he, however, comes in a great package with an unconventional talent which allures and stuns people around.</p><p>The most fun-loving and dynamic soul on the planet, he doesn’t stop making fun of own self and close friends whenever free. From snapping a hilarious picture to sharing a close bond with siblings and enjoying quality time, he does it all, which proves that one can’t have better man and friend to stand by than Michael. Being an avid fan of Zendaya, he doesn’t miss a second to promote her and express his genuine feelings for her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-and-personal-life></span>Family and Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Michael J. Woodard</strong>&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;<strong>married</strong>&nbsp;or engaged to the date. Currently focused on building a music career, he perhaps isn’t thinking about having a girlfriend and hanging out for quite a time now.</p><p>Michael, a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was born to Wanda Martin Woodard, who worked in a half-an-hour radio show named H.O.P.E. Victorious on Facebook Life. Being enigmatic about his private life, he, however, has concealed most of the information about his life, mostly on childhood and parents.</p><p><strong>Quick Info:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Parents:</strong>&nbsp;Wanda Martin Woodard (Mother)</li><li><strong>Wife:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Children:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong>&nbsp;Unmarried</li></ul><p>Growing up in a Christian household in Philadelphia, he must have attended plenty of prestigious school in the country, but he never opened much about his academic qualification and educational background, continuing to stay mum on it. In 2016, he moved to L.A. after being acknowledged by Musicians Institute, College of Contemporary Music, aiming to study music and art.</p><p>20-years-old, Michael is most probably single as he hasn’t opened up about his marital status with media personnel. Additionally, none of his pics or posts on Instagram triggered about him having a soulmate or special one in his life. Handsome and dazzling followed by a unique voice, he has enough time for marriage and engagement but as of now, he is focused in making a resilient career out of music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZmLWisctmoWavn6Sxor7DaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./miley-cyrus-husband-liam-hemsworth-relationship-public-breakup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Did The Opposite With Their Relationship Than What They Promised When">&larr;

Thankfully for all of the people who consider themselves to be fans of Megan Thee Stallion, of which there are many, it is clear that she has both of those attributes in abundance. After all, Megan has long been known for her vocal skills and it is incredibly obvious that she stands out in just about any crowd. In fact, as a result of her obvious beauty, <a href=#>Megan became the first rapper on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit Issue</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the obvious career momentum that Megan Thee Stallion has, several of the biggest stars in the music business have wanted to work with her. For example, Megan has collaborated with stars like <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, BTS, Doja Cat, Nicki Minaj, and most notably, <a href=#>Cardi B</a> among others. Given all of the music stars who’ve put their stamp of approval on Megan, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that she has made a fortune already even though she still hasn’t been in the spotlight for too long. In fact, according to celebritynetworth.com, Megan is worth $8 million as of this writing which begs an obvious question, how does she spend her incredible net worth?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Beyoncé, Megan Thee Stallion, Doja Cat And Nicki Minaj Made Billboard History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-thee-stallion-rsquo-s-wealthy-lifestyle-includes-expensive-cars-and-houses>Megan Thee Stallion’s Wealthy Lifestyle Includes Expensive Cars And Houses</h2><p>If you asked most celebrities about the tabloids and paparazzi, they would have some extremely strong things to say about the forces that habitually invade their privacy. Of course, most people wouldn’t want random strangers taking photos of them everywhere they went in public so that sentiment is very relatable. On the other hand, it is remarkable that even as they complain about wanting privacy, most stars don’t put much effort into keeping information about where they live off the internet.</p><p>When it comes to Megan Thee Stallion, virtually nothing is known about where exactly she lives, how much her home cost, and how big it is. However, the talented performer has revealed that she calls Texas home. On top of that, Megan Thee Stallion has given the public some very limited views of her home while being interviewed during quarantine. As a result, it is known that Megan’s abode has extremely high ceilings and almost certainly cost her a hefty amount of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike the details of her home, a lot more is known about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Thee Stallion's car collection</a>. For example, Megan has made it clear that she is the owner of a grey Rolls Royce Dawn, a vehicle that costs $350,000, and that isn’t taking into account the costs of customizing the vehicle. Considering that pictures of Megan’s Rolls Royce show custom rims and trim, it is obvious that she invested some extra cash in her vehicle. On top of that, it also has been reported that Megan has a Mercedes Benz SLS AMG and a Lexus IS250.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Facts About Chris Evans' Ferrari Collection</a></span></p><p>On top of Megan Thee Stallion’s home and cars, she is known to enjoy several other things that cost a lot of money. For example, Megan has a history of being spotted wearing expensive clothes and accessories like Luis Vuitton handbags. More notably, Megan seems to love wearing incredible pieces of jewelry regularly. Even assuming that Megan only owns a small amount of the jewelry she has worn in public, with the rest on loan by designers, that still would have cost her a lot of money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Haters Troll Cardi B’s Excessive Purse Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-thee-stallion-is-more-generous-than-most-stars>Megan Thee Stallion Is More Generous Than Most Stars</h2><p>Even though it is clear that she has enjoyed the fruits of her labors, it is important to take note of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how generous Megan Thee Stallion has been</a> since she first earned fame and fortune. More importantly, unlike some stars who give back in really showy ways, Megan’s generosity seems to be extremely genuine. After all, instead of giving millions to the latest cause that has everyone’s attention, Megan has used her money to help fight longstanding issues that too many people ignore.</p><p>Of all the ways that Megan Thee Stallion has given back, the most impressive has to be her decision to open a chain of assisted living facilities in her hometown, Houston, Texas. According to Megan, she saw her grandmother take care of her great-grandmother when both women were old enough that they should have been able to take it easy. That is what inspired Megan to open the aforementioned facilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2021, Megan announced that she and Fashion Nova were creating Women on Top. According to Megan, the partnership was “a new female empowerment initiative that will give away $1 million in grants and scholarships over the course of this month to amazing women entrepreneurs, female students, women-owned businesses, and women-focused charities.” Megan also seems to be very proud to have personally set up a scholarship for BIPOC women pursuing higher education. On top of all that, when a fan of hers passed away and their friend tagged the rapper in their Twitter post about the loss, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan pledged to bankroll the funeral</a>.</p><p>Based on all Megan Thee Stallion’s aforementioned charitable efforts and the ones that there wasn’t enough space to touch on here, one thing seems clear, she is a really kindhearted human being.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Megan Thee Stallion's Net Worth Soared In 2021</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3q1tMSeZKyskaG5qrvNZqWerF2svLPAx2alnqycm7a5ec%2Brpp2tk6m2sLqMnZyapF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-do-celebrities-make-on-the-masked-singer-compared-to-judges-salary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Do Celebrities Make For Appearing On The Masked Singer, And How Does It Compare To What The">&larr;

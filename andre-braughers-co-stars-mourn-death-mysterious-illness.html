While an official cause of death hasn’t been revealed, Allen explained that Andre was suffering from a “short illness,” though she didn’t specify further.</p><p>Braugher’s breakthrough role is widely considered to be 1998’s Glory. He starred opposite Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, who won an Oscar for the movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre went on to play Detective Frank Pembleton on Homicide: Life on the Street for seven seasons, even earning an Emmy for the iconic role in 1998. He would go on to be nominated for 11 Emmys over his lifetime.</p><p>He later had an equally famous television role with Brooklyn 99, which he stayed with for 8 seasons. With a more light-hearted tone than his previous projects, Andre acknowledged that Brooklyn 99 was a major shift in his career, one he was grateful for.</p><p>"I just felt as though it was an opportunity to do something strikingly different from the rest of my career," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said in 2019</a>. "I like it because it just simply opens up my mind and forces me to think in a different way. So I think I've become much more sort of supple as an actor, and more open to the incredible number of possibilities of how to play a scene."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brooklyn-99.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Where Was The Cast Of Brooklyn 99 Before The Show?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some of the cast members of Brooklyn 99 already had accomplished Hollywood resumes, while for others it was their star-making role.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andre-braugher-rsquo-s-ldquo-brooklyn-99-rdquo-co-stars-mourn-his-death-online>Andre Braugher’s “Brooklyn 99” Co-Stars Mourn His Death Online</h2><p>With a decade-long career, there’s no denying Andre made his mark in Hollywood.

"Can’t believe you’re gone so soon," Crew captioned a tribute post to Andre.</p><p>"I’m honored to have known you, laughed with you, worked with you and shared 8 glorious years watching your irreplaceable talent. This hurts," he continued alongside a photo of Andre. "You left us too soon. You taught me so much. I will be forever grateful for the experience of knowing you. Thank you for your wisdom, your advice, your kindness and your friendship.

I love you, man."</p><p>Andre’s other Brooklyn 99 co-star Dirk Blocker <a href=#>released a similar message on social media</a>, writing, "Fiercely intelligent, remarkably kind, supportive, generous and possessed a deep and extraordinary talent, and had even more to offer. I am devastated. I love him. The 9 years I was able to work with him and to just be in his presence was truly a blessing. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, Joel McKinnon Miller, wrote in a post, "An actor prepares… Sending love to Andre’s family and friends and all of us who had the honor of working with him.”</p><p>Needless to say, Andre Braugher will be sorely missed by fans and friends alike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimnqjvsCunqGdoqh6pLuMrKuaqqNiurDB0adknZ2RqbVuudisq56qmaTCtHnIpaOnnaOofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-lapidus-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-311546-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Lapidus Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;

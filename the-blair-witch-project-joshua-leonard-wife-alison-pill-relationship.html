He called it a "flight into marriage and parenthood." The actor continued to Interview Magazine, "All of a sudden, everybody I knew got married and pregnant.

He said, “I was absolutely a cocky kid when I did ‘Blair Witch,’ and I think part of the glory and the downfall of being a cocky kid is that you don’t know you’re a cocky kid. Now being a husband and a father and 20 years into a career, I am very aware of all the things I don’t know, and may never know, and very aware of the fact that life and filmmaking should not be some solipsistic journey.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dl7mitdFmrqKsk516sb7Oo5ycrF2fvLS01JpkpZ2fo66zsIywoJ%2BdXZa5qr%2FOp2SpoZyherOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./this-is-how-anthony-mackies-life-and-net-worth-changed-after-joining-marvel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="This Is How Anthony Mackie's Life And Net Worth Changed After Joining Marvel">&larr;

With The Tortured Poet Department’s release scheduled for a few days away, many Swifties expect Taylor to shed light on her break-up with Joe, or at least provide some telling lyrics that’ll provide context.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:16</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-isn-t-the-only-artist-who-has-turned-down-the-super-bowl-halftime-show-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Isn't The Only Artist Who Has Turned Down The Super Bowl Halftime Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift isn't the only musician who has turned down the Super Bowl Halftime Show, with other big-name artists also saying no to the gig.</span><p>Though Joe still hasn’t made any statement, someone close to him and his family has given her two thoughts on Taylor’s new music – his brother’s girlfriend, Brynn Cartelli. She expressed excitement over Tay’s album, admitting she’s counting down the days until its release, suggesting not all of the Alwyn family is on bad terms with the pop star after her and Joe’s split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-alwyn-family-may-not-be-upset-with-taylor>The Alwyn Family May Not Be Upset With Taylor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_what-other-stars-have-said-about-taylor-swift-good-and-bad-_bk_a1.jpg><p>Cartelli, 20, sparked intrigue among social media users after sharing a TikTok video on Thursday, April 11, where she was seen eating with the caption, "Deeply upset with myself for lurking and thinking that I wouldn't hurt my own feelings."</p><p>Following up with another video, Cartelli captioned it, "Anyway, so excited for April 19," a clear reference to the release date for Taylor’s album.</p><p>Interestingly, both videos featured her in the same outfit, eating from the same bowl, and positioned at the same angle. While the second clip has been deleted from her account, it was subsequently reposted elsewhere, including X (formerly known as Twitter) causing speculation and curiosity among her followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Brynn’s videos were vague and perhaps meant to stir up speculation as to their meaning, some social media users speculate that she has a side of the story to share regarding Taylor and Joe’s break-up. One person tweeted, “Oh these brothers are having a flop-off,” while another person wrote, “She definitely has some things to say.”</p><h2 id=how-joe-reportedly-feels-about-taylor-rsquo-s-upcoming-album>How Joe Reportedly Feels About Taylor’s Upcoming Album</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar51592977-1.jpg><p>There have been various reports claiming <a href=#>Joe is nervous about how Taylor’s album</a> will portray him and whether it will send her dedicated fan base after him more so than they’ve already been, even though Taylor is now in a public relationship with Kansas Chiefs player Travis Kelce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s safe to say that Joe is bracing himself for a lot of questions. No one is safe,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source previously told Life & Style</a>. “Joe should be worried about what she reveals.”</p><p>During their relationship, it was speculated that Alwyn wasn’t as comfortable with the spotlight as Swift, given that they kept their romance largely private, though she’d been more open about her relationships in the past (as well as the present with Kelce). Taylor also has a reputation about opening up about her love life in her songs, so fans are confident she’ll do the same on her upcoming record.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design-2023-10-19t065511-258.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>An Inside Look At Taylor Swift's Relationship With Her Parents</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the many health struggles her parents have faced, Andrea and Scott Swift always prioritized Taylor's dreams and passion for music.</span><p>Taylor confirmed new music was on the way in February at the Grammys, despite being in the middle of her Eras world tour.

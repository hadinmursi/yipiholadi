Whether it's about her reignited romance with Ben Affleck, people she's been linked to, or a flame from yesteryear, the media has long been fascinated by Lopez's love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to being a major star, Lopez was married to Ojani Noa. <a href=#>His life has changed a lot </a>since being married to Lopez, and the former lovers found themselves in a legal entanglement years back, when Noa was on the cusp of releasing a ton of information about their romance.</p><p>Let's take a look at the lawsuit in question, and how things got ugly between the former partners.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-and-ojani-noa-were-married-briefly>Jennifer Lopez And Ojani Noa Were Married Briefly</h2><p>Before really getting into the meat and potatoes, it's important to get some context regarding Jennifer Lopez and Ojani Noa's previous relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a>, "Jennifer Lopez's first husband was Ojani Noa, who was a waiter when they started dating. The two met early in Lopez's acting career when he was an aspiring actor and working at Gloria Estefan's restaurant. They married in 1997 and by 1998 were divorced."</p><p>Interestingly, after the pair separated, they were still on decent enough terms for Lopez to offer him a job.</p><p>"After their divorce, she decided to hire him to manage her restaurant, Madres, in 2002. But she fired him only six months after he started working," Hollywood Life reports.</p><p>Over time, however, there have been problems between the two. Apparently, thanks to some iron-clad NDAs, many details of their romance can't be shared, and at one point, Noa and Lopez found themselves in a nasty lawsuit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Serenades Ben Affleck With New Song On Their Wedding Anniversary, Despite Contemplating Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noa-wrote-a-tell-all-and-was-sued-by-lopez>Noa Wrote A Tell-All, And Was Sued By Lopez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52704253.jpg><p>It was revealed that Noa was coming forward with a tell-all book, something that would have violated the previously-mentioned NDAs that were part of his marriage to Lopez.</p><p>"Noa's plans for a book were revealed in a January 2006 article in the New York Post describing the proposed book as a 12-chapter "tell-all manuscript" under the title: "The Unknown Truth: A Passionate Portrait of a Serial Thriller,'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reports.</p><p>The site also revealed that Noa was willing to keep the book under wraps, for a small fee of $5 million.</p><p>Instead of doing nothing and letting her ex win, Lopez filed a lawsuit against her former beau.</p><p>So, what was in this turbulent tome that was so bad?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to media accounts, the unpublished book alleges that Lopez had multiple affairs during her 11-month marriage to Noa, including one with salsa-singer Marc Anthony, her third and current husband," the site reported.</p><p>Not a great look for Lopez, and she acted quickly.</p><p>Eventually, the lawsuit came to an end.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Hated Her South Park Parody And It Caused Members Of Her Team To Get Fired</a></span></p><h2 id=the-lawsuit-ended-but-another-was-around-the-corner>The Lawsuit Ended, But Another Was Around The Corner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52684006.jpg><p>According to CBC, "The arbitration settlement, reached in April, was disclosed Wednesday when Lopez's attorney filed papers asking that the judgment be confirmed. The singer-actress won $200,000 US in damages, and the rest in arbitration costs and legal fees. Lopez, now 36,sued Noa, 31,claiming he violated a contract preventing him from revealing private information about their relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's a big win for Lopez, who found herself on the defensive from her ex.</p><p>For Noa, this had to be a major blow. Not only did he not get to drag his ex's name through the mud, but he also failed to get the cash he seemed so desperate to get his hands on. Furthermore, he wound up owing Lopez a couple hundred thousand.</p><p>Most might assumed that things ended there between the two, but they would be wrong.</p><p>Years later, Lopez and Noa were back in court, and this time, Noa was looking to have their story turned into a project for Telemundo.</p><p>Long story short, lawsuits were filed by both sides. Lopez wanted to stop any stories from coming to light, and the other side claimed that Lopez had a hand in ruining them in Hollywood.</p><p>Per The Hollywood Reporter, Ed Meyer, who was in cahoots with Noa, "was going to get revenge by releasing onto the Internet “11+ hours of previously unseen home videofootage [sic] of Jennifer Lopez and Ojani Noa,” including (possibly) a naked Lopez."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Lopez had the last laugh. Again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Squashes Divorce Rumors With PDA-Filled Photos From Her 54th Birthday Party With Ben Affleck</a></span></p><p>This situation lasted way longer than Lopez would have liked, considering how Noa kept trying to get stories out into the open, violating his NDAs. It must have cost a legal fortune, but in the end, all of what Lopez wanted to stay behind closed doors remain there to this very day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmLAtrHDZpinZZWterW7jKyrqKhdnbauecWrpqZloKqvrbXSoaCnn12WeqO7zqRkmpqfqsFuwMeeoKtlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jim-tom-hedricks-obituary-how-did-he-die-moonshiners-star-cause-of-death-676311-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jim Tom Hedricks Obituary: How Did He Die?

Amazon Prime is making headway, and <a href=#>it is the home of many amazing TV shows</a> and <a href=#>movies for fans to enjoy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carnival Row is an Amazon Original that caught fans' attention with its 2019 debut. A second season of the show was announced, but there has been a huge delay in bringing it to the streaming service.</p><p>Let's take a look at the show and learn why there has been a delay.</p><h2 id=39-carnival-row-39-is-off-and-running>'Carnival Row' Is Off And Running</h2><p>2019 marked the beginning of Carnival Row, and original series on Amazon Prime. The steaming service already had hits, and they were hopeful that this series would rope in lovers of fantasy.</p><p>Starring Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne, Carnival Row's debut season was both stylish and intriguing. The previews showed that the series would be unique, and in what was refreshing for audiences to see, it was a fantasy series that was not based on a book series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series did not get a great reception from critics, but fans loved the show. An 87% rating with the fans on Rotten Tomatoes is huge, and it certainly indicates that the series was able to rope in its target demographic with its first season.</p><p>After the show's debut season, Amazon made the wise decision to let the world know that the story would be continuing with a second season, though a specific time regarding the second season's premiere was not specified.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will There Be A Season 2 Of Netflix's 'The Ultimatum'?</a></span></p><h2 id=season-two-has-been-confirmed>Season Two Has Been Confirmed</h2><p>In 2019, executive producer Marc Guggenheim was asked <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how season two was going</a>, and he seemed rather optimistic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Great. We have a very extensive pre-prep period, and we’re just about done with all eight scripts for the second season, and we don’t even start production until the end of September. So we’re very, very far ahead of the curve, which is, quite frankly, where we like to be, and how you need to do a show of this size," he said.</p><p>Guggenheim also revealed that season two would have 8 episodes, much like season one had.</p><p>"Yeah, we liked it. We structured season 1 as an eight-chapter novel because we noticed that some short-order shows are structured like a movie where it’s a three-act structure. Travis and I found the middle of the season tends to lag a little bit on those shows. With our approach, in the middle is when everything really ramps up and changes. So it’s allowed for us to tell a story where every episode is impactful, and every episode is chockfull of big moments and character reveals," Guggenheim revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of that sounds great, but that was 3 years ago, and to date, we have yet to see the second season of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related <a href=#>Will There Be A Season Two Of 'The Woman In The House Across The Street From The Girl In The Window'?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-the-delay>Why The Delay?</h2><p>So, why has there been such a massive delay for the second season of Carnival Row? Well, like other projects, this series was dealing with the pandemic, meaning that production was stalled right in the thick of things. Not only that, but personal matters for some performers could have also played a part in the delay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Epic Stream</a>, "Production started in November 2019 but was halted in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, when the production crew commenced preparations to resume filming in the first week of May, Amazon had yet to announce an official release date. Soon it was reported that the show was only three weeks away to wrap up the production, which resumed in May 2021 in the Czech Republic to film the remaining scenes which involve "</p><p>"Orlando Bloom who was not available last year due to the birth of his first child with Katy Perry. It didn't take much time to conclude filming, but it would take additional time to wrap the post-production for the critically-acclaimed series," the site continued.</p><p>That is more than a few hurdles to clear, and this is what has kept Carnival Row on ice for some time now.</p><p>Fortunately, a lot of progress has been made, and fans are optimistic that Amazon will be dropping season two of the show later on in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'And Just Like That' Finale: Will There Be A Season Two?</a></span></p><p>Season two of Carnival Row could be its last, so here's hoping that the show is able to deliver a powerful second season and give fans its absolute best.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Will There Ever Actually Be A 'National Treasure 3'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60edKemKynnmLBuLuMqJ1mm5Gnu6rCwKVkq6enYrGmuMCynJ1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1417496-wwe-main-event-spoilers-taped-on-10-30.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="WWE Main Event Spoilers (Taped On 10/30)">&larr;

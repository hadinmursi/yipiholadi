The actor once again dominated the box office in the last couple of years, keeping his career at a high standard. What's even more remarkable is the fact that the actor is also thriving in terms of the way he treats the media and his fellow co-stars and colleagues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we're going to highlight particular moment of the actor off-camera. We'll take a closer look at what his peers have to say about working with him - we're also going to take a closer look at his life as a dad.</p><p>In addition, we'll reveal the classy footage a fan caught of Tom Cruise entering an SUV. It seems like all these years later, Tom Cruise still hasn't lost his classy gentleman gestures.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Tom Cruise Came Across As A Completely Different Person During His First Ever Appearance With David Letterman</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-cruise-is-a-class-act-with-his-peers-in-hollywood-according-to-multiple-co-stars>Tom Cruise Is A Class Act With His Peers In Hollywood According To Multiple Co-Stars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tom-cruise-hayley-atwell.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is working alongside Tom Cruise a career-altering opportunity, but it seems like the actor is also a class act on-set. He gifted a former co-star a pen, while he's also known for helping others and is always willing to be available as well.</p><p>Mission: Impossible co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Pegg also discussed the actor's generosity.</a></p><p>"Of all the mist of stuff that's around him, in the center of that mist is a generous, sweet guy who looks after everybody. He leads from the top down. And he's kind of inspiring to be around. There's no one else like him, he's the last movie star of the old kind."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Actress That Turned Down A Role To Star Alongside Both Nicole Kidman And Tom Cruise</a></span></p><p>Pegg continues, "When I first met him, it was my first time to Hollywood," he told the outlet. "He came to set the first day we met, he immediately made me feel very welcome, very at home, was incredibly generous. Over the 17 years that we've been friends, I feel lucky to get to see a part of him that everyone else wants to see, which is just the guy," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And he is just a guy. He's an extraordinary guy. He's a guy who feels the obligation to the audience to risk his life for them to kind of entertain them."</p><p>That sentiment seems to hold true for others in the business as well. Cruise continues to keep a high standard into his 60s, truly remarkable.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-made-sure-a-colleague-entered-the-vehicle-before-he-did>Tom Cruise Made Sure A Colleague Entered The Vehicle Before He Did</h2><p>Fans are always interested in watching footage of Tom Cruise in candid situations, finding out what the actor is truly like. For years, Tom has consistently been a class act in public, with his signature smile.</p><p>One moment in particular went viral, showing Cruise acting like a pure gentleman alongside a colleague. The two are about to enter an SUV, but before Cruise gets into his ride, he makes sure that his team member enters first, despite all the chaos surrounding him at the time. The moment can be viewed in the YouTube short below, posted by CelebrityWotNot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>An Author Complained About Having Tom Cruise In Her Film Adaptation, But Later Realized She Was Very Wrong</a></span></p><p>Over 1K fans took to the video, giving their thoughts.</p><p>Among the most liked comments includes, "How can this guy always be a in a good mood."</p><p>"This guy never forgotten who pays for his lifestyle and that's why he is respectful to his fans."</p><p>Fans would also call Tom Cruise a true moving star based on the way he handles himself, mixed in with his acting abilities.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-goes-out-of-his-way-for-the-little-things-in-life-steve-spielberg-revealed>Tom Cruise Goes Out Of His Way For The Little Things In Life, Steve Spielberg Revealed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tom-cruise-paid-for-his-daughter-isabella-s-wedding-but-was-banned-from-attending.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Cruise great with his peers and the fans, but the same holds true as a family man. <a href=#>Steven Spielberg made quite the reveal about Tom Cruise</a> and how he was always there for his two children, Connor and Isabella. That held true during the shoot of Minority Report. The actor literally stepped aside mid-scene in order to fix an issue his children were having.</p><p>"There were times that I was about ready to say “Action,” and the phone rang. If it was Tom’s kids, everything stopped for that. Just when he was preparing for probably the hardest scene he has in the whole movie, the phone rang. Anybody else would have looked up with anger in their eyes, but he immediately broke character and walked off and took the call."</p><p>"Connor or Isabella had stuck an eraser in their eye or something like that. It was not serious, but Dad came to the rescue. I thought it was amazing. I have been known to say [when talking about his own kids], “I’ll call them back after the shot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Tom Cruise, his dream was always to be a father and as this story indicates, he takes his role very seriously. Cruise still holds a close relationship with both kids, while his closeness to Suri seems to be strained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdmL%2B2tdKeZLCZo2LBqbGMqZyrnpWYwW6zxKerpZ2dlrtuw8itn2aZXZi8rbjEmp6unV2eu26tjJyYp5yZmXquu8yepa1lk5bCqLTTZpmyZZaWu7R7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ty-burrell-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-201473.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ty Burrell: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me">&larr;

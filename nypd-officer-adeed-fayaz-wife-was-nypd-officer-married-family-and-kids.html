He arranged a meeting with a man selling a car (Honda Pilot) on Facebook Marketplace for $24,000.</p><p>Adeed Fayaz and his brother-in-law went to an address in East New York, Brooklyn, at around 7 pm. On their arrival, the seller asked them if they were carrying guns while walking down a driveway, said the NYDP chief of detective James Essig at a news conference on Tuesday.</p><p>Adeed and his brother-in-law said no. Then the seller pointed a gun at Fayaz’s head and demanded money. When the late officer said he had no money, the man pointed his gun at Fayaz’s brother-in-law.</p><p>That gave the officer a chance to break free of the headlock. The gunman then opened Fire, hitting Mr. Fayaz in the head, before fleeing and shooting both men.</p><p>According to Chief Essig, the brother-in-law could take a gun off Mr. Fayaz’s hip and Fired at least six shots at the seller as he ran.</p><p>Further, Chief Essig adds, Police linked the 2011 BMW to the so-called car seller fled using dashcam footage from Mr. Fayaz’s brother-in-law.</p><p>Adeed Fayaz’s funeral is scheduled for Thursday in Brooklyn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-adeed-fayaz-murderer></span>Who Is Adeed Fayaz Murderer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Randy Jones, a 38-year-old man, has been taken into Police custody concerning Adeed Fayaz’s death.</p><p>Jones is charged with one crime of first-degree murder, two charges of attempted robbery, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and two counts of second-degree murder, one of which requires it to be committed during a robbery.</p><p>Detectives discovered Randy Jone on Monday night at a Days Inn in Nanuet, New York, using more surveillance footage. The suspect was found with his girlfriend and five children.</p><p>Randy was arrested using the late officer Adeed Fayaz’s handcuffs. Chief Essig said they wanted the suspect to know what he had done to Mr. Fayaz, and his cuffs were on him. Essig added it would send a powerful message.</p><p>The NYPD is investigating if Randy Jones is connected to other reports of Facebook Marketplace robberies, including one that occurred in early January “just down the block.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKappbFuu8WfoJydomKupbHEnWSfmamWx27DyJ%2BcZq%2BRqHqvxc%2BdZKielp6wpr6MppirqpmasW6ywKagpbFdlrulecqim6xn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./obituary-who-is-italya-montserrat-mojica-death-cause-is-he-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Obituary: Who Is Italya Montserrat Mojica?

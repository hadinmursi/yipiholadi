Bought and changed from the previously known Bit.ly app, this service allows users to post and view videos from a few seconds to up to ten minutes long. App members can find any kind of content; from more widely popular markets like art, <a href=#><strong>Marvel</strong></a>, and pets to niche videos like frog crochet and <a href=#><strong>Harry Potter</strong></a> x New Girl crossovers, there is something for everyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>From TikTok To Hollywood: TikTokers Who Became Actors</a></span></p><p>With so much freedom to create, many users quickly rose in popularity due to their likeability and relatable content. One of these creators is Chris Olsen, who has been making TikTok videos for about two years. He shares a wide variety of videos, including moments from his everyday life and his iconic “I’ll bring you coffee” travel videos. His life has not always been glorious, though, and he worked hard to get to his current standing. Here is Chris Olsen’s inspiring story to fame, from rehab to walking the red carpet.</p><h2 id=who-is-tiktok-star-chris-olsen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is TikTok Star Chris Olsen?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Olsen is a TikTok star who is currently only 24 years old. He joined the app in 2020 and quickly gained a following due to his comedic presence and the fact that he has openly stood on the platform of being gay and supporting those in the community with him. Olsen is loved for his authenticity, as he will share cuts from his online therapy sessions and videos he records on emotionally taxing days.</p><h2 id=his-mother-struggled-with-addiction-when-he-was-young><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Mother Struggled With Addiction When He Was Young</span></h2><p>Chris Olsen was exposed to addiction as a child. When he was only 14, his mother admitted herself to rehab to seek help for her addiction. This caused such a strain on the home that just a year later, his parents ended up getting divorced. With so much struggle going on in his home life, Chris ended up having struggles of his own as he continued to grow up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About TikTok Star Addison Rae</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-olsen-began-drinking-as-a-teen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chris Olsen Began Drinking As A Teen</span></h2><p>At age 16, Chris Olsen turned to alcohol. He was struggling with the split of his parents and, whether intentionally or not, began following in his mother’s footsteps. By the time he was 17, he faced the fact that he had developed a serious alcohol addiction. He was constantly drinking and used that substance as a form of coping with his difficulties.</p><h2 id=chris-olsen-39-s-experience-with-rehab><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Olsen's Experience With Rehab</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he officially became an adult at 18 years old, Chris Olsen decided to take the first step in seeking help. He checked himself into a rehab facility and worked at leaving alcoholism in the past. For a few months he remained sober but ended up falling off the wagon when he started college. At age 19, he went back to rehab for a second time, determined to turn his life around.</p><h2 id=chris-olsen-graduated-from-college-in-2021><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Olsen Graduated From College In 2021</span></h2><p>Chris Olsen dropped out of college when he was 19 to put all his effort into rehab. When his time was up, he re-enrolled in school to work towards his degree. After three hard years of work, Olsen celebrated graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts in Musical Theater from the Boston Conservatory Berklee School of Music. He is looking forward to continuing his career in entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Celebrities Who Finally Joined TikTok In 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=ian-paget-amp-chris-olsen-were-tiktok-39-s-favorite-couple><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ian Paget & Chris Olsen Were TikTok's Favorite Couple</span></h2><p>One of the main draws to Chris Olsen’s TikTok channel was the relationship content he would share. For a while, he was boyfriends with fellow content creator Ian Paget, and the two were widely loved for the pranks they would play on each other and their comedic banter. The couple announced their split in the beginning of January, and while fans were devastated at the breakup, were happy to see it was amiable.</p><h2 id=chris-olsen-partnered-with-39-meta-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chris Olsen Partnered With 'Meta'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As he has continued to dig into his entertainment career, he has recently been asked to partner with ‘Meta’ for the sixth issue of the Metamorphosis magazine. This company is run by members of the AAPI community, and Chris Olsen was thrilled to not only be the cover model, but to talk about his experiences as an AAPI creator as well as being in the LGBTQ+ community.</p><h2 id=chris-olsen-now-walks-the-red-carpets><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chris Olsen Now Walks The Red Carpets</span></h2><p>Although Chris Olsen came from a humble background and faced many trials and struggles through his teen years, he has pushed and come out on top. Just within the last four years, he has successfully finished rehab, started and graduated from college, developed a TikTok following of over 7.6 million people, and began walking red carpets. His most recent red carpet look was for the amfAR Gala held last month in France.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which 'Hype House' Cast Member Has The Biggest TikTok Following?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMikq6ijXajBor6MnJ%2BroaNivK2%2FxKdkoqajpbaztc2gZKysn6fGbsDOZp2apZVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gigi-hadid-two-tone-jeans-denim-amazon-affordable-celebrity-style.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gigi Hadid's 2-Tone Jeans  This Pair Looks Nearly Identical">&larr;

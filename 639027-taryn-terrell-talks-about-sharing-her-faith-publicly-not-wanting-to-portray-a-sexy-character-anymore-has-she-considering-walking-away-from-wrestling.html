You can read a few excerpts below: &nbsp;</p><p>You know I found that when I was looking for God I didn’t have the resources, and it was hard for me to connect with more mature Christians, so I thought that if somebody could watch my testimony and see me as an infant Christian, you know, I’m just a baby and I’m still learning, maybe they could connect and they could realize exactly how to find God for themselves.</p><p>You know, it’s been really cool because a couple wrestlers have texted me or reached out by phone and said, you know, they’re Christians as well and they would love to share their journey with me, and talk.&nbsp;And it’s just a really great way not only that I can connect with other wrestlers who have been in the entertainment field which is a very tempting world but you know that helps me mature as a Christian, and get better connections with my peers which gives me a better connection with God.</p><p>That is something I’m actually struggling with now.&nbsp;You know it certainly wasn’t the fault of WWE or the fault of any other entertainment company that I’ve worked for. It wasn’t the fault of Playboy&nbsp; These were all my decisions and these were, you know, my life choices that I made that were, you know, certainly not of a Christian lifestyle.&nbsp;Like you said, the sexiness and, you know, me essentially being a temptation to men and, you know, that’s sort of the thing I learned that I really want to be a role model. I truly do. I want to be able to help other people get saved just as people helped me to be saved so, you know, that is something I’m struggling with now and realizing that, you know, even in the way that I dress it is important to be Christian.&nbsp;It is important to be more modest and I want to use the ability that I have as performing to connect people.&nbsp;You know, I love to perform.&nbsp;I love to entertain.&nbsp;God gave me those skills to do so and I’ve learned that He put me on this Earth to be able to use that and to reach people, and to bring people near God.</p><p>Absolutely. I think that I have played, and recently, I have played an even more sexy character than I was used to playing, and it’s something that I prayed on and I know that’s not who I want to portray anymore.&nbsp;I know that’s not who I am and it’s not who I want to portray, and how can I connect with people, and sort of live that double standard.&nbsp;And yes, if I cannot find a way to use God and be godly in the things that I do then yes, it is time to walk away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgpJyZ2tvXamus8XNZqueqqKaua1505qjpKtdlq%2BwwdNmqqGZop67qHnHnqlmnpGewal5z66ZpaGTocZuus6tZLCZnqm2r7OMraZmqJ%2BnwbOt2GaYZquVrcZur8eaqZqbpJq%2Fbq3NsqSoqpVitaK%2FjKyfnmWTpLu0tcOeqaKml2LEorjKoqWgZZGsrrp5xaumpmWnp7K0wMuipaA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-pierson-b-52s-love-shack-songs-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The B-52s Were Too Weird to Mess With">&larr;

He accused his wife, Kim Kardashian, of cheating on him with rapper Meek Mill.

The words on the album cover are meant to be sarcastic, but there is obviously some truth to it also. His diagnosis is something he, like many others, clearly struggles with, isn't his fault, and should be considered with compassion. Here are the celebs who defended him and the ones who did not.</p><h2 id=defended-kanye-halsey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Defended Kanye: Halsey</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halsey</a> understands Kanye West's situation more than most because she also has Bipolar herself. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She posted to social media</a>, "No jokes right now. I have dedicated my career to offering education and insight about Bipolar disorder and I'm so disturbed by what I'm seeing." What she was seeing online was a bunch of trolls poking fun at Kanye's mental breakdown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say, "Personal opinions about someone aside, a manic episode isn't a joke. If you can't offer understanding or sympathy, offer your silence." Her statement was very articulate, heartfelt, and straight to the point.</p><h2 id=didn-t-defend-kanye-t-i><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Didn’t Defend Kanye: T.I.</span></h2><p>T.I. took to Instagram to address the part of Kanye West's breakdown where he spoke negatively about Harriet Tubman. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T.I. posted</a>:</p><p>"Nahhhh WE Can't let you do that Ye'...</p><p>What WE NOT gon do is slander nor disrespect the legacy of our heroic Queen Harriet Tubman by telling falsities in an attempt to discredit the contributions she made to LIBERATE OUR PEOPLE. Cuzz U BUGGIN‼️ THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TOO FAR‼️ I truly hope you either have a logical explanation for all this ... or get the medical attention you so desperately need Bro. I say this with love and sincerity."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>T.I.'s anger over the disrespect of Harriet Tubman was met with a flood of agreements from people in his comment section. T.I. did end the message with "love and sincerity," which means he wasn't trying to necessarily start a war with Kanye West. The message T.I. wrote seemed to be filled with frustration and confusion at Kanye's recent actions.</p><h2 id=defended-kanye-kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Defended Kanye: Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a> defended Kanye West, despite the fact that he accused her of cheating on him with Meek Mill and that he mentioned an intimate detail about their relationship - the fact that she almost terminated her pregnancy when she was carrying her firstborn daughter, North. Kim posted three pages of typed words to her Instagram story, explaining the situation with Kanye West's Bipolar disorder.</p><p>She asked that others be compassionate and empathetic towards Kanye West and their family right now, as they go through this difficult time. After the fact, Kanye West posted an apology tweet that was directed at Kim and the two met up in person in Wyoming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=didn-t-defend-kanye-50-cent><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Didn’t Defend Kanye: 50 Cent</span></h2><p>50 Cent has never been one to sit back and keep quiet. Wherever drama goes, he tends to follow and he ALWAYS has something to say, which can sometimes be negative, malicious, or cruel.</p><p>50 Cent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote this message to Kanye</a>&nbsp;on social media for the world to see: “Oh sh**, fool you said you almost killed your daughter. Your wife knows best sit your a** down. Happy wife happy life.” The comment was mean and spiteful. It was also totally uncalled for. Kanye West's daughter, North, is seven years old this year, which means that she is old enough to comprehend what is going on around her. This comment from 50 Cent is just something extra added to their family situation.</p><h2 id=defended-kanye-justin-bieber><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Defended Kanye: Justin Bieber</span></h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Justin Bieber visited Kanye West at his ranch in Wyoming and "encouraged" Kanye to let Kim Kardashian fly down and talk to him in person. He told Kanye to stop avoiding her, according to a source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Justin Bieber has really grown up and matured since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marrying Hailey Baldwin</a>. It seems like she is a good influence on him. He might only be 26 years old this year, but he has become wise and very good at giving life advice to others.</p><h2 id=didn-t-defend-kanye-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Didn’t Defend Kanye: Taylor Swift</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift and Kanye West</a> have been in an ongoing feud since the 2009 VMA Awards when he grabbed the microphone out of her hand on stage, in front of everyone, and told&nbsp;the world&nbsp;that Beyonce deserved to win instead of her. Things in pop culture were never the same after that day.</p><p>Amidst the Kanye West drama revolving around his mental breakdown, Taylor Swift has released a new album. It is called Folklore and it includes a song called "Peace." One of the lyrics&nbsp;says, "robbers to the east, clowns to the West.” Since she capitalized West and not east, fans speculate she is referring to Kanye West as a clown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=defended-kanye-elon-musk><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Defended Kanye: Elon Musk</span></h2><p>When Kanye West announced that he would be running for president, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk</a> was one of the individuals who jumped on board in support. When Kanye started tweeting a bunch of rambling tweets, Elon also stepped in.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon stated</a>, "When [Kanye] was about a third of the way through the tweet rampage, just to see if he was doing OK, I sent him a text saying, you know, just checking on you, a lot of people are worried, just wondering if you’re OK." The fact that he checked in on Kanye West was thoughtful and considerate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk Supports Kanye West Running For President in 2020</a></span></p><p>Musk went on to say, “He called me back and he actually seemed fine. He video FaceTimed me and he was in Wyoming with a bunch of friends. He seemed fine on the call. But it sounds like things are, you know, not fine. There seem to be a lot of issues.” His concern for Kanye West is apparent and it is obvious that he cares about Kanye West, without any judgment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=didn-t-defend-kanye-paris-hilton><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Didn’t Defend Kanye: Paris Hilton</span></h2><p>Right after Kanye West announced that he would be running for president, Paris Hilton jumped on the&nbsp;sarcasm train <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and tweeted</a>, "#ParisForPresident" to her&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-vw2c0b r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">16.8 million f</span></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1re7ezh r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ollowers.</span></span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1re7ezh r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">She was obviously being sarcastic and throwing it out there that if Kanye can make claims about running for president, she can too ... and so can just about anyone.</span></span></p><h2 id=defended-kanye-chance-the-rapper><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Defended Kanye: Chance The Rapper</span></h2><p>Chance the Rapper has done his best to defend Kanye. In terms of West's idea to run for president, he stated that he trusts Kanye West over Joe Biden, even though most people would say otherwise. Chance the Rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted several tweets</a> about the presidential campaign and his own personal views.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chance The Rapper Supports Kanye West Presidency But Doesn’t Need Help From Terry Crews</a></span></p><p>On his list of what he would like to see the next president do?

Octavia Spencer is one of these people. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She tweeted</a>, "Too much foolishness today. #SitAllTheWayDown. It’s obvious that some people live in a bubble. It’s about time to burst it. #2020vision." She was very blunt about her opinion!</p><p class=p1>Octavio Spencer is not the only celebrity who feels this way. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple celebs</a> have spoken out against the idea of Kanye West running for president and so have several non-celebs. People are concerned that a split vote between Joe Biden and Kanye West could lead to bad results.</p><p class=p1><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gayle King Sets Up Mental Health Chat Line Because She’s Worried About Kanye West</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl8Buw8eoZJ2dlpq7pbHDZpuinJ6peqWxxZ6lnWWblru6sYywnKysXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./new-stand-up-comedy-specials-this-month-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 New Comedy Specials You Should Definitely Watch (When You Have a Moment)">&larr;

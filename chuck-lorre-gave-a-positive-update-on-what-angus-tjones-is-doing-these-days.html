Nonetheless, the show enjoyed massive success, and Angus T. Jones was a major part of that. However, once he exited the show, the actor went off the map and fans haven't heard much since.</p><p>Fans were given a bit of an update recently thanks to Chuck Lorre. Jones made a cameo in Bookie. We'll reveal how that went, and what Lorre had to say about the child star's current status. In addition, we'll also take a closer look at Lorre's thoughts on Sheen possibly reuniting with Jon Cryer down the road.</p><p>Let's get started.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:18</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sean-s-guest-appearance-on-two-and-a-half-men-was-overshadowed-by-now-deceased-star-harry-dean-stanton-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sean Penn's Guest Appearance On Two And A Half Men Was Overshadowed By Now Deceased Star Harry Dean Stanton">Sean Penn's Guest Appearance On Two And A Half Men Was Overshadowed By Now Deceased Star Harry Dean Stanton</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sean Penn and Harry Dean Stanton both appeared in the same Two and a Half Men episode with Charlie Sheen, but Stanton's acting really stood out.</p><h2 id=chuck-lorre-said-angus-t-jones-is-doing-quot-great-quot-with-projects-outside-of-hollywood>Chuck Lorre Said Angus T.

However, when it comes to words from the actor himself, he hasn't really said much in the recent years. Speaking alongside Variety, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Lorre discussed the reunion between Angus T. Jones and Charlie Sheen on Bookie</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While discussing the moment, Lorre revealed the actor's current status.</p><p>“He’s doing great,” Lorre said. “He’s a terrific guy. It’s an extraordinary thing. We started working together, he was eight years old. He’s a little boy, right? With just uncanny comedic instincts, without thinking. It was just in his DNA. And to work together again, 20 years later, we had fun. It was a wonderful afternoon. Everybody had the same reaction: ‘Oh my God. You’re a grown man!'”</p><p>As for what he's doing, Lorre didn't get into specifics, but revealed the former child star is working on things outside of Hollywood.</p><p>"Conversations with Angus would lead me to say no, he's done," he shared. "He has other goals in mind."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/_the-sad-truth-about-conchata-ferrell-s-health-after-two-and-a-half-men-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Sad Truth About Conchata Ferrell's Health After Two And A Half Men">The Sad Truth About Conchata Ferrell's Health After Two And A Half Men</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Conchata Ferrell stayed active after Two and Half Men, but her health declined in 2020.</p><p>Fans will be pleased to know that the actor is doing just fine these days away from the spotlight.

However, things completely changed after Angus went on a rant, going after Two and a Half Men and referring to the series as "filth."</p><p>He said, “If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching Two and a Half Men. I’m on Two and a Half Men and I don’t want to be on it. Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it’s just entertainment.

Jones rarely mentioned his parents throughout his run on Two and a Half Men and there might be a specific reason for it.</p><p>The <a href=#>meltdown caused lots of concerns, especially from his co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Jon Cryer</a>. Soon after, Angus would issue an apology.</p><p>"I apologize if my remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity of which I have been blessed. I never intended that.”</p><p>He continues, “I have been the subject of much discussion, speculation and commentary over the past 24 hours. While I cannot address everything that has been said or right every misstatement or misunderstanding, there is one thing I want to make clear. Without qualification, I am grateful to and have the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and Half Men with whom I have worked and over the past ten years who have become an extension of my family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, things ended off on the right note as the actor returned for the show's finale.

It’s foolish to say never. It’s still to me more gratifying and fun to do new stuff. And to let let the stuff we did in the past be the past.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Lorre and his own issues with Sheen, he's glad things are finally in the past.</p><p>“It was just a lot, for both of us, we were grateful to be past it,” he said of reuniting with Sheen. “Here we are, so many years later. And there was a lot of gratitude. I think it was warm. People said it must have been healing and you know, it was. It was wonderful to not just give the man a hug. We worked together and we had a blast. It was very reminiscent of those wonderful eight years where we had a lot of fun making a show that we worked hard on and we were proud of.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoa2ToHqtu9GrnGafkauybq2MqaasoaSew6Z51KmbmqyVYryvedahmK1lkaO0tr%2BMraGoppWoeqq%2FjJ2moqaXYsGpsdKeZJ2Zqah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-gabrielle-union-was-let-go-at-americas-got-talent-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gabrielle Union Criticized the Culture at Americas Got Talent.

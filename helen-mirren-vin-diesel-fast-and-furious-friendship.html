In the franchise, the award-winning actress plays Magdalene ‘Queenie’ Shaw, a career criminal and mother to three other known criminals – Jason Statham’s Deckard Shaw, Luke Evans’ Owen Shaw, and Vanessa Kirby’s Hattie Shaw.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is A Live-Action 'Fast & Furious' TV Show Still Happening?</a></span>Mirren made her debut in the 2017 film The Fate of the Furious. Since then, the actress reprised her character in the spinoff Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and more recently, F9: The Fast Saga.And while there’s no word yet on whether Mirren will appear in any of the upcoming Fast & Furious films (although <a href=#>Jason Momoa is confirmed to be joining the cast</a>), no one can deny that Mirren’s chemistry with Diesel is unique. It’s quite intriguing too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-mirren-had-been-lobbying-to-join-the-franchise-for-years>Helen Mirren Had Been Lobbying To Join The Franchise For Years</h2><p>Perhaps, what fans don’t realize is that Mirren had been a longtime admirer of Diesel. In fact, as far back as 2015, the highly revered actress was already in awe of the action star.</p><p>“I’m a huge fan of Vin Diesel,” Mirren declared while on Late Night with Seth Meyers. “It came from me watching him make a speech once at some ceremony, he was just so smart, and so funny and so cool, and I just sort fell a little bit in love with him right there and then…”</p><p>“I love you Vin,” the actress added. “You don’t know who I am, but I still love you.” Around the same time, Mirren also openly discussed her dream of joining Diesel’s box office hit franchise. In fact, she took the opportunity to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch herself while discussing action movies</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My great ambition is to be in a Fast & Furious movie,” Mirren revealed. “I so want to be a mad driver in a Fast & Furious movie. My claim to fame is I always do my own driving — I was on Top Gear, and I did [my lap] in a very good time. I keep putting it out there, and they never ask me.” Intriguingly, she also added, “I’ll be in Fast & Furious 8.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Pics Of Vin Diesel Proving He’s Nothing Like His Fast And Furious Character</a></span></p><p>Not long after, Mirren finally got to meet Diesel while at Golden Globes party. There and then, the multi-awarded actress took her chance. And she didn’t just suggest the idea of joining the franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, <a href=#>Mirren had claimed multiple times that she “begged” for a role</a>. While on Live with Kelly and Ryan though, Diesel recalled the meeting just a bit differently. According to the franchise’s lead star, he recalled Mirren saying, “Vin Diesel, get your act together! … You know I love you! I want to be in Fast & Furious!”</p><p>Nevertheless, there was never any begging necessary for Diesel. Mirren was an actress that he could never say no to.</p><p>“She’s very intimidating, despite her 5’2’’ frame. You want to make her happy. You definitely don’t want to disappoint her,” the actor remarked in his speech for the Film Society of Lincoln Center when Mirren received the Chaplin Award.</p><p>“For a tough New Yorker like myself, I was intimidated, and I don’t get intimidated easily. She inspired something in me. I thank God for the opportunity to have made magic with her.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-mirren-and-vin-diesel-have-formed-a-tight-bond-since>Helen Mirren And Vin Diesel Have Formed A Tight Bond Since</h2><p>Just as Mirren had predicted early on, the actress went on to join Diesel in The Fate of the Furious (a.k.a. Fast & Furious 8). And when she officially came on board, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirren wasted no time giving input on her character</a>.</p><p>“I mean, obviously she was the mother of Jason Statham's character, so there is an East End connection there,” she explained. “But immediately I knew how I wanted her to be this sort of tough matriarchal, powerful woman who had to make her own way in life, and has always done it slightly on the dodgy side.”</p><p>Audiences first see Mirren appear during the later part of the movie when Diesel’s Dom Toretto needs help in rescuing his child from Cipher (Charlize Theron). The moment their characters get together, however, the chemistry was instant, and Mirren knew it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“That's completely natural chemistry. It was there right from the very beginning of my first meeting with Vin,” the actress remarked. “And I just adored him immediately, and he's always been so kind and lovely to me.”</p><p>The bond between the two stars also grew behind the scenes. In fact, Mirren and Diesel hang out when they’re not on set. The actors were even spotted sharing a dance while attending the Dolce and Gabbana Alta Moda show in Venice.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Vin Diesel & The Cast Get Candid About Making The Fast & Furious Films</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirren has even met Diesel’s actual family</a>. “I met Vin’s mother, who’s lovely, and I think there’s something there as well: He’s very, very close to his mum and obviously loves her,” the actress said. “She’s lovely, very sweet and gentle. Not like Vin at all, but he loves her very much!”</p><p>As the Fast & Furious saga reportedly comes to an end, it would surely be nice to see Queenie and Dom at least one more time. So far, there’s no indication of that happening. But then, knowing Diesel is with Mirren, all the Oscar winner has to do is ask.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Dwayne Johnson Isn't Done With 'Fast And Furious' Just Yet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqSVo3qutdGrnKdlpp67brDInqqepF2brrTAjJqlnWWWqr%2Bqu9SsZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2FHoqdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-little-mermaid-2023-cast-net-worth-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Much The Remake Stars Are Actually Worth">&larr;

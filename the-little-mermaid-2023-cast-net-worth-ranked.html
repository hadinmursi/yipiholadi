Fans of the original movie are excited to see their beloved animated masterpiece converted to live action. There are certainly some fans concerned with the film, for various reasons. Disney's live action remakes haven't been too well received this far. The cast may be too diverse for some people, in a way that feels disingenuous and wrong. All in all, the film, expected to be released on May 26, 2023, is likely going to break a lot of box office records regardless of the negative feedback. It's just that anticipated of a movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Part of the hype for the film comes from the absurdly famous cast. Due to their fame, many have wondered how much money the A-list actors have made. Here's how much some of the actors have made, and where they rank overall compared to one another.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-halle-bailey-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Much Is Halle Bailey Worth?</span></h2><p>Before starring as Ariel in the movie, Chloe was one half of the R&B duo Chloe x Halle. They've made some pretty big songs, and also have some pretty influential fashion lines. Chloe has also acted in the hit show Black-ish, so this movie isn't her first rodeo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Has The Little Mermaid Already Earned Halle Bailey More Acting Gigs?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Sun, Chloe has a net worth of $2 million. It's a little less than one would expect of Chloe's stature, but The Little Mermaid will certainly help make that figure balloon up.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-simone-ashley-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Much Is Simone Ashley Worth?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/simone-ashley-on-red-carpet.jpg><p>Simone is one of the lesser known members of the cast. She's played in big films such as Detective Pikachu and Straight Outta Compton, albeit having lesser roles in those films. Simone's role in The Little Mermaid has yet to be revealed, so fans will have to wait and see who she plays.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Simone Ashley Revealed Her Struggles On the Set Of 'Bridgerton'</a></span></p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Simone has a net worth of $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-jacob-tremblay-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Is Jacob Tremblay Worth?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jacob-tremblay-on-the-red-carpet.jpg><p>Jacob's biggest role thus far has been as Luca in Luca. A highly beloved film, it seems everyone who's watched the movie has loved it. They've complimented Jacob for his portrayal, including Justin Bieber, who's <a href=#>also loved Jacob's role in Luca</a>. Jacob's going to be playing Flounder.</p><p>Jacob's net worth falls in line with the previous young actors. According to Canadian Knowledge, Jacob also has a net worth of $2 million. All of this is to be expected, as all of these actors are very young and slightly unproven.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-awkwafina-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Is Awkwafina Worth?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From this point onward, the cast consists of more older and experienced actors and actresses. This includes iconic Asian actress Awkwafina, the comedian who has starred in Crazy Rich Asians. Awkwafina was recently canceled <a href=#>for using an urban accent</a> in one of her sketches, but it hasn't stopped her from portraying Scuttle, a character in line with Awkwafina's eccentric personality.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Awkwafina has a net worth of $8 million.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-daveed-diggs-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Is Daveed Diggs Worth?</span></h2><p>Daveed is going to be playing the iconic role of Sebastian, a character all Little Mermaid fans love the heck out of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daveed did a lot of research for this role</a>. He sees the diverse cast as a positive, and overall sees the potential for this movie to influence millions of fans. That includes his role, which is why he researched the role so much.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-javier-bardem-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Is Javier Bardem Worth?</span></h2><p>Javier Bardem is one of the most accomplished actors on the planet. His role as Anton Chigurh is seen as one of the best acting performances ever. Javier's Anton was a chilling take on an emotionless psychopath who cared little about his actions. His critically acclaimed performance in that film opened the doorway for more roles in the James Bond and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises. It's also opened the doorway for Javier's role in The Little Mermaid. He's not a sociopathic villain in this Disney movie. Instead, he's playing King Triton, Ariel's father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Javier Bardem And Penelope Cruz's Relationship Origin May Be Seen As Deeply Problematic</a></span></p><p>Javier has a net worth of $30 million according to The Sun. That's pretty good for an actor who isn't the biggest household name. Not that he cares about how famous he is - he doesn't even know who the Kardashians are.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-lin-manual-miranda-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Much Is Lin-Manual Miranda Worth?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lin-Manuel-Miranda-As-The-Aeronaut-In-His-Dark-Materials.jpg><p>Lin-Manual Miranda revolutionalized theater, so it shouldn't be surprising he has a reported net worth of $90 million. The actor has also appeared in the hit musical animated film Encanto. That film, as well as The Little Mermaid, sees Lin handle the musical sections of the film. It wouldn't make any sense if Lin-Manual didn't participate in the music. His role actually hasn't been 100% confirmed yet, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has been very vocal </a>about the backlash towards the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-melissa-mccarthy-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Is Melissa McCarthy Worth?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/melissa-mccarthy-shocked-and-terrified.jpg><p>Melissa has been cast as Ursula. A lead role in this film shouldn't be surprising for her, as she's an outright A-list superstar now. However, her success hasn't always been the case for her. <a href=#>Melissa used to be worth less than 5 dollars</a>, but now she's worth an estimated $90 million.</p><p>Melissa called playing Ursula <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an "out of body experience"</a>. There's no doubt her role as the over-the-top evil villain will be entertaining to watch, as it's the most perfect casting in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1doba1wMueZKadoqKuqrCMa2dra12YrrTAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyrmKejlZl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hotel-artemis-review-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hotel Artemis Is an Inventive, If Meandering Genre Hangout">&larr;

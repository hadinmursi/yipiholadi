For that reason, it often seems like people have written off the <a href=#>DC Extended Universe</a> as nothing more than Marvel’s main competitor trying to recreate their success. While there is some truth to that belief since every movie studio wants their own MCU, that ignores the fact that the MCU has followed in the footsteps of several past DC films. For example, superhero movies likely wouldn’t exist today if it weren’t for past movies and shows based on DC characters like Batman and Superman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that Superman is so important to cinematic history, it should go without saying that it is a big deal anytime a new actor is cast as the legendary superhero. For example, ever since <strong><a href=#>Henry Cavill</a></strong> was hired to headline Man of Steel, he has been one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood. Of course, given Cavill’s superstar status, it makes sense that a lot of people have become very interested in every aspect of his life. Most notably of all, a lot of Cavill fans are fascinated by his girlfriend, her controversies, and her amazing life story.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Nicolas Cage's Cancelled 'Superman' Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=henry-cavill-rsquo-s-girlfriend-natalie-viscuso-rsquo-s-controversial-past>Henry Cavill’s Girlfriend Natalie Viscuso’s Controversial Past</h2><p>Even though anyone who dates a major star should be prepared to have the media examine every aspect of their lives, a lot of those people don’t have much of a remarkable past. As a result, when Superman actor Henry Cavill began dating a woman named Natalie Viscuso, a lot of people assumed that her background wouldn’t provide them with much gossip. As it turns out, however, Viscuso has a “reality” TV past that is pretty easy for most people to judge. After all, Viscuso was featured in an episode of My Super Sweet 16, a show that is known for its focus on spoiled teens, that aired in 2005.</p><p>According to Elle, Natalie Viscuso’s episode of My Super Sweet 16 has a pretty amazing description. “At 15 years old, Natalie is now living in a $5 million house and cruising around town in her dad's Bentleys and Ferraris. What more could she want? How about being the most popular girl at school?” If that description wasn’t proof enough that Viscuso was a spoiled teen, then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie’s comment about enjoying her family’s wealth</a> that she uttered during her My Super Sweet 16 episode makes that very clear. “Money really is not an object to me, I’m really spoiled….sometimes I feel guilty for that but I deserve everything I have because I’ve always been just the nice girl, never the rich girl.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Worst TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked By IMDb</a></span></p><p>Of course, starring in a show about being spoiled as a youngster is likely to make anyone controversial if they wind up in the spotlight later in life. Unfortunately, however, that isn’t the only reason why Natalie Viscuso has faced a backlash since she began dating Henry Cavill. The reason for that is that someone unsurfaced a photo of Viscuso seemingly in blackface from the neck down. Following that image coming to light, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viscuso spoke to The Daily Mail and offered up an explanation and apology</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Firstly, I’d like to say that I’m sorry if this image surfacing has caused any offense. It is a photo from 2008 for a TV show in Namibia. The tribe I was living with painted my skin as part of an initiation ceremony and an acceptance into their culture. Never in a million years did I think that this would be offensive, in fact, I felt honored that they would initiate me. However, with the lessons that we are all learning in today’s climate, it is important that I recognize that this is potentially hurtful. My deepest and most sincere apologies.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sarah Silverman Under Fire For Hypocrisy, Fights For Authentic Jewish Representation Yet Wears Blackface</a></span></p><h2 id=natalie-viscuso-rsquo-s-impressive-achievements>Natalie Viscuso’s Impressive Achievements</h2><p>Ever since Natalie Viscuso has found herself in the public eye, almost all of the coverage about her relationship with Henry Cavill has focused on her controversial past. While that makes a certain level of sense since Viscuso has a headline-grabbing past, that also is a shame since her life has gone in a fascinating direction. After all, according to her LinkedIn page, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viscuso has become the vice president of television and digital studios at Legendary Entertainment</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone unfamiliar with Legendary Entertainment, it is a production company that has worked on several notable films. For example, Legendary Entertainment produced films like The Dark Knight, Inception, Man of Steel, Jurassic World, Straight Outta Compton, Dune, and all of the recent big-budget English Godzilla films.</p><p>On top of Natalie Viscuso’s career achievements, it seems like she and Henry Cavill have a loving relationship based on their social media posts. After all, Viscuso and Cavill have both uploaded images that show the couple spending private time together on social media. On top of that, when Cavill noticed all of the hate that has been directed at Viscuso, he took to Instagram to defend his girlfriend and private life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>A Chronicle Of Henry Cavill’s Love Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqairnqkrdWio6Vll56%2FrbLRopynnF2jrrWty6KcZq6ZqLC2v85mo6iulWK5qrLEZq6hp12stqexjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./young-thug-lyrics-ysl-indictment-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here Are the Rap Lyrics Being Used in the YSL Trial">&larr;

The community has risen against gun violence as they voiced their thoughts to the authorities.</p><p>Similarly, the existence of gun violence has claimed the lives of innocent kids, and people who are victims of such crimes. The lack of gun control in the US has perpetuated the presence of crimes and death in the big cities.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-seandell-holliday-16></span>Who Is Seandell Holliday, 16?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seandell Holliday is a 16-year-old teenager who was walking in around the Bean statute during the evening of the night when he was shot by hate-harboring individuals.</p><p>Seandell was shot in the chest and he was immediately taken to the hospital but after 2 hours, the teenager was announced dead by the hospital.</p><p>Likewise, the Mayor of Chicago stated that such crime shall not be tolerated and further actions shall be taken, it was a second shooting this week near the iconic statue of the park.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=teenager-shot-dead-is-the-suspect-arrested></span>Teenager Shot Dead- Is The Suspect Arrested?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The alleged perpetrators of the crime, two individuals were taken for questioning, and two weapons were also recovered from the scene of the murder.</p><p>The mayor of Chicago advocated that young kids are welcome in the city but they must respect the sanctity and integrity of the city. He added, that he won’t let kids carry firearms in the public.</p><p>Moreover, mayor further expressed his sadness towards the mother of the boy. Many members of the community and friends of the kids were giving sympathy and sending their prayers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=seandell-holliday-parents-and-obituary></span>Seandell Holliday Parents and Obituary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chanell Holiday seems to be the parent of Sandell as she posted the picture and information about the death of the son. She seems to be saddened by the grief.</p><p>Chanell studied at Kennedy-King College, also Seandell seems to have other siblings as well. He seems to be an intelligent kid with a bright future ahead of him. However, his life was cut short due to his death by gun violence.</p><p>Seandell father’s information is unavailable, the information about the shootout has been recently opened up. It is likely to take some time for Seandell’s family to perform Obiturary, to clear the body from the authorities and investigations.</p><p>Nevertheless, a whole community has united against the death of the boy, as people are frustrated due to lack of gun control and surge of gun violence in the city.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ysnJqmlJq5rXnHqKOloZSWxm59lWarnp2elrSmvoysn6isXZmyorCMoqVmpZmhuaa6yK6kZqiRp7hufo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-alanis-morissettes-daughter-only-calls-her-by-her-full-name.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Alanis Morissette's Daughter Only Calls Her By Her Full Name">&larr;

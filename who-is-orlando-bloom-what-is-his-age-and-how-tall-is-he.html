He has starred in 4 of the 15 highest-grossing films of all-time. He is a talented actor no doubt plus he is an ‘eye candy’ and deserves every accolade he has received in his career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-bio-%e2%80%93-who-is-orlando-bloom></span><strong>Age, Bio – Who Is Orlando Bloom?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was born Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom on the 13th of January 1977 in Canterbury, England.

He then went to St Edmund’s School, Canterbury.</p><p>Orlando Bloom relocated to London to pursue a two-year A Level course in drama, photography, and sculpture in 1993, at the Fine Arts College in Hampstead. He then went ahead to join the National Youth Theatre where he spent 2 seasons and won himself a scholarship to learn at the British American Drama Academy. As he was learning and honing his craft, he began to pick up small roles on television.</p><p>His professional acting career began with some roles on TV, featuring as Noel Harrison in Casualty (1994-1996) and as Peter Drinkwater in Midsomer Murders (2000). His film debut was in 1997 where he featured alongside Stephen Fry in Wilde. Orlando then proceeded to study acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London.</p><p>All his investments in his acting career did pay off as he landed his first major role and one of his biggest just 2 days after his graduation from Guildhall in 1999. He was cast to play Legolas in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (2001-2003). He originally auditioned for a different part but the director – Peter Jackson saw and recognized some potentials in him and cast him as Legolas.

He was named ‘People’s hottest Hollywood bachelor in the tabloid’s 2004 list. In the same year, he was named the 12th most influential person in British culture by cultural experts.

Orlando Bloom also received the BAFTA Britannia Humanitarian Award in 2015.</p><p>He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 2nd of April 2014.

They finally won the award in 2003 for the 3rd film – The Return of the King.

(It’s a Jetway, by the way.) “My fear for the future of our language is that the suffix -ussy is just going to be accepted and part of regular speech,” he says in the video, before breaking out some examples of the grim future he foresees: Outlets are now “chargussies,” tape decks are “cassettussies,” and people give birth through their “vajussinal canal.” In certain pockets of the internet, the -ussification of language is inescapable. Riffing off “bussy’ (a portmanteau of “boy” and “pussy”), now everything is a cat or a cavity. A <a href=#>calzone is a pizzussy</a>. A wine bottle has a <a href=#>winussy</a>. Princess Fiona has an <a href=#>ogussy</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bro, yall needa stop adding ussy to everything <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/akJ0AnuLSV</a></p>— Lj ©️ (@ZoeLupezZ) <a href=#>January 8, 2022</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzs5jr00203g6ihgstrzcz@published data-word-count=61>Bussy is bustin’ out all over social media. From Andrew Garfield’s Spadussy to <a href=#>Trader Joe’s Citrusy spices</a>, whole chunks of the internet are being&nbsp;-ussified. Adding -ussy to the end of words — any word — has been a fun obsession of the extremely online, and fluctuates between being praised as high art and criticized as yet another meme done to death.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzshxs00263g6i1lcq1usy@published data-word-count=80>The insertion of this new suffix into our lexicussy is mostly confined to online speech, but it reflects a general memefication of language and destabilization of meaning that is popular with the young. Especially the “gays and the theys,” people for whom rigid taxonomy has often been oppressive. This -ussification is 1) kind of annoying, perhaps even on purpose. And 2) a great equalizer. It is subversive, it is Bottom Rights. Everybody and everything has been reduced to their hole.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzshxu00273g6i9dd8liuo@published data-word-count=83>“Traditionally, gay men have been on the margins of society and have had to come up with new forms of vocabulary to delineate a different way of looking at the world,” says Paul Baker, author of <a href=#>Fabulosa! The Story of Polari, Britain’s Secret Gay Language</a>. “This is often based on a kind of arch humor and tends to use a gamut of stylistic devices — alliteration, acronyms, rhyming, blending, punning, assonance, etc. — that are designed to be memorable and make others laugh.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzshxv00283g6izozcpoi0@published data-word-count=104>I spoke to two linguists, neither of whom cited a specific moment when people started putting their whole suffussies into -ussification. But a terminally online friend pointed the finger at a <a href=#>James McAvoy stan account</a>, which tweeted “andrew garfield puts his whole garfussy into all his roles actually,” in December of last year. As <a href=#>MEL</a> noted, “bussy” was already all over gay Twitter in 2021. Sometimes in earnest, sometimes making fun of the “<a href=#>Hi Gay!</a>” energy of corporate Pride efforts. They also claim that bussy broke into straighter spaces when Buzzfeed made Taron Egerton read the word in one of its “<a href=#>Thirst Tweets</a>” videos.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzshxw00293g6ikn3zb76d@published data-word-count=71>“​​This is a new one for me, I’m afraid. But I’m intrigued,” responded William Leap, professor emeritus at American University and co-editor of the Journal of Language & Sexuality, when I asked him specifically about the “connectussy.” “I know that Freud suggests we can view containers (and thereby container metaphors) as female references, so a Jetway as a XX-ussy, okay — that is a location that becomes a place of insertion.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzshxy002a3g6iqj3pxg1f@published data-word-count=70>But Leap disagreed that -ussification is always feminizing. For example, when people say Willem Dafoe put his whole Dafussy into being Green Goblin. “For putting the Dafussy into Spider-Man, ‘Dafussy’ comes out as a masculinist metaphor. Dafoe rumoredly has a large point of reference&nbsp;there,” he said, referring to the fact that Dafoe had to have a stunt cock on Antichrist because Lars Von Trier found Dafoe’s actual member <a href=#>confusingly large</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"can the spider-man come out to play?" was a good enough line in the original movie but goddamn willem really put his whole dafussy into it for no way home holy shit</p>— Kil || (NWH SPOILERS) (@zemokils) <a href=#>January 14, 2022</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzsvvp002l3g6i4n7oay0o@published data-word-count=126>So -ussification has expanded beyond queer borders into a more general- audience meme world. Baker lays the mainstreaming of queer language at RuPaul’s feet, hunty, saying, “RuPaul’s Drag Race came along — condragulations, entertaintment, Rupologize — and it has helped to bring the practice a bit further into the mainstream.” This mainstreaming comes with a soupçon of appropriation. Bussy frequently appears on <a href=#>lists</a> of words that originated in AAVE and were taken by white people. Doubtless, it will join its fallen brethren “and i oop,”&nbsp;“throwing shade,” and “yas queen.” On the other hand, much -ussification seems like a deliberate attempt to destabilize English as a whole. The goal is not to run a trend into the ground, it is to obliterate any notion of fixed meaning.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckyvzt5w4002r3g6i3fvqwiqa@published data-word-count=121>“-ussy could indicate the female’d/feminized/femme or the masculine’d/masculinized/ butch, depending on context,” said Leap. “That is quite ‘queer,’ in the sense that term need not have a fixed or stable reference, and neither need the references to gender or sexuality with which the term is associated.” This puts -ussification in the realm of “gorgeous gorgeous girls,” and “the girls who get it, get it.” Instead of being a wholly gendered category, being a gorgeous gorgeous girl is a marker of kinship. To be gorgeous gorgeous is to be beautified by association with other cool bitches, by one’s unique and hip habits, and by one’s confidence. Or as <a href=#>one TikToker put it</a>, “The girls who girl, girl. The girls who girln’t, gorn’t.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>We Asked Linguists About the -Ussification of the Internet</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpa2dgZnyjwdKssGasopq7pXnLoqWgrZmowbR5xLGnpZmZo3upwMyl</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-was-brewstew-michael-death-cause-what-happened-to-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Was Brewstew Michael Death Cause?

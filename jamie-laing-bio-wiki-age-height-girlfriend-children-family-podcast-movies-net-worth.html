He felt that the market had very little variety to offer. He also felt that the quality of the candies was also not up to the mark. During his university days, he gave his business idea the final thought.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span></p><p>He combined three of his loves- candies, fashion, and girls to create the sweet-treat company; ‘Candy Kittens.’ This confectionery line specializes in making gluten-free gummy sweets infused with unusual flavors. All their products are claimed to be made from real fruit juices. The company later launched a few exotic fruit and vegetable flavors.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>The use of natural ingredients, authentic flavors, and attractive packaging made the company unique. Jamie runs the business along with two of his friends namely Ed Williams and Warren Crane.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span></p><h1 style=text-align:center><strong>Frequently Asked Questions About Jamie Laing</strong></h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jamie-laing></span><strong>Who is Jamie Laing?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jamie Laing is a British actor, entrepreneur, and social media influencer who was born and brought up in Oxford, England.

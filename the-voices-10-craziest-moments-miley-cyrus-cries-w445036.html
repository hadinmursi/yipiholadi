On <i><a href=#>The Voice</a></i>‘s Monday, October 24, episode, things were getting a little punchy in the first knockout rounds. <b><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></b> admitted, “It’s so scary!” And … with a new round came a new outfit for the “Wrecking Ball” singer. This time it was a cute black shirt with “Team Miley” stitched in gold, a big black bow on top of her head and <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> that looked like mini polar bears … or cats? Anyone? In other news, <b><a href=#>Blake Shelton</a></b> was showing the strain, <a href=#><b>Alicia Keys</b></a> had a hat-cident with Tim McGraw, and Miley got tearful.</p><p><b>1. Sundance Head sings Miley.&nbsp;</b></p><p>When old-school country singer Sundance Head picked Miley’s hit “The Climb” for his knockout round, reactions were mixed. Blake, for one, wasn’t sure, saying, “This song choice is blowing the brains out of my head,” while Miley was clearly thrilled, sang along and then actually curtseyed to Sundance to thank him. <b><a href=#>Adam Levine</a></b>’s take? “No one with that big of a beard has ever covered a Miley Cyrus song.” OK. Thanks, Adam.</p><p><b>2. Timbre!</b></p><p>When Josh Gallagher sang “My Maria,” Alicia loved his sound. “The timbre in your voice was really special,” she said, using a musical term for tone and quality. Poor Blake looked like he’d never heard of it.“Timbre, huh?” he said. “I love that word!”</p><p>“You can use it now,” Alicia said kindly. Looks like Blake got schooled.</p><p><b>3. Hat head.&nbsp;</b></p><p>This week, country duo <b>Tim McGraw</b> and <b>Faith Hill</b> were on set helping out. But first there had to be an awkward moment when Alicia and Tim tried to hug — only both were wearing huge hats. Alicia said, “You gotta be way wide when you hug with hats!” Tim explained his wife Faith dealt with that issue a <i>lot</i>: “She’s used to me — she deals with it all the time.” See? This is what a happy marriage is about — compromise.</p><p><b>4. Miley tears up.&nbsp;</b></p><p>When sisters Whitney and Shannon sadly got the boot after their duet of “I Won’t Give Up,” they actually made Miley cry. “We’re so blessed,” Shannon said. “I got to go on this journey with my best friend.”</p><p>Poor Miley couldn’t help the tears welling. “Oh, God, here I go,” she said.</p><p>Save the sadness for the finals, Miley — time to toughen up.</p><p><b>5. Blake’s got “Miley brain.”</b></p><p>When Ali sang Sade’s “No Ordinary Love,” Blake tried to figure out if Miley would pick her or knock her out. “I spent that knockout round trying to think like Miley, and it scared the hell out of me,” he quipped.</p><p>Miley took this comment surprisingly well.</p><p><b>6. Word games.&nbsp;</b></p><p>As usual, Alicia was trying to give her opinion, while Blake and Adam just wouldn’t stop chattering.“Good gosh,” she complained, “there’s no speaking around these people!”</p><p>Miley seemed confused by this, since no one in the history of the world has stopped her from talking. Ever. “I get plenty of words in,” the “We Can’t Stop” singer said, shrugging. Yes, Miley, we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/voice-recap-tuesday-46c00334-55bb-462b-829a-bdb93eadf03c.jpg><p><b>7. Miley goes it alone.</b></p><p>At one point Miley looked around and realized the other judges had all headed backstage for a break without her even noticing, leaving her alone on stage in her chair. “They left me!” she squealed. “I kinda like it! Isn’t this nice with me as the only coach?” she asked the audience. “This is the way it should always be!” Imagine? Miley in charge. The audience seemed more stunned than anything.</p><p><b>8. Adam is … bubbly?</b></p><p>When Simone Gundy sang “Midnight Train to Georgia,” Adam called her “Bubbles,” insisting, “That’s her nickname.” But then he picked her, and she was so pleased that luckily she seemed to have forgotten about the whole “Bubbles” thing …</p><p><b>9. Tim McGraw bows down!</b></p><p>When Wé McDonald rehearsed her blow-you-away version of Mary J. Blige’s “No More Drama,” Tim McGraw actually got down on his knees and bowed to her! Faith, on the other hand, was much more normal. After Wé said she sang Mary J. with her mom in the car, Faith sweetly replied, “I sing with the windows open with my daughter. too. I’m going to add this to my repertoire.”</p><p>So cute. So normal. Take note, Tim.</p><p><b>10. Blake’s personal hell.</b></p><p>So while Adam didn’t help things by proclaiming, “I’m Elton John,” after a bit of a singalong with Faith, he then made it worse by talking over Blake. Blake was having none of it. “Shut your mouth!” he told Adam. “My biggest fear is when I die, I’ll continue to hear your voice. It’ll be my hell.” Blake was clearly cracking under the strain, but Adam was loving it. “You should be so lucky,” he said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>Will Blake totally lose it by the end of this season? Seems possible …</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Were Miley’s earrings cats or polar bears? It seems important! And is she building a strong team?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>The Voice</i> airs on NBC Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2rvKqvxKxkamhdmL%2Bixsieqq1lnaS6prrTrGSmoZyaxm6v2KusrGWTp7amv4ywa21tYGiDcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-prenn-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-590634-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thomas Prenn Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;

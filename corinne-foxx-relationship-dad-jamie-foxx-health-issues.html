Like his acting career, this front has also seen its fair share of turbulent times, one of the earliest being his often tumultuous relationship with his firstborn, Corinne.</p><p>As it turns out, the Django Unchained star was a tad overprotective of his daughter during her teenage years, making for some rather embarrassing moments for the young Corinne. However, with Foxx's recent health scare, things appear to have taken a drastic turn. So, how exactly has the once-rocky relationship between Foxx and his daughter changed?</p><h2 id=does-corinne-foxx-get-along-with-her-parents>Does Corinne Foxx Get Along With Her Parents?</h2><p>Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx is adored worldwide for many traits—his unquestionable acting prowess, magnetic charisma, and larger-than-life personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when it came to raising his firstborn daughter, Corinne Foxx, these traits didn’t win him much favor. The duo repeatedly clashed over Jamie’s penchant for embarrassing Corinne with his over-the-top antics.</p><p>“My dad was very over-the-top, very charismatic,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared with New York Post in 2021</a>. “I was more reserved and quiet so we had these funny moments of tension or him embarrassing me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corinne-jamie.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Corinne</a>, the renowned comedian would wear “clothing that is too young for him” and go out of his way to intimidate her boyfriends by knocking on their doors. “I think we always had this yin and yang relationship,” she admitted to New York Post, “he was really over-the-top and I was more reserved and that’s where in my teenage years a lot of conflicts happened.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the now 29-year-old has since come to appreciate the humor in Foxx’s parenting style, she wasn’t exactly his biggest fan as a teenager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corinne-foxx-s-turbulent-relationship-with-dad-jamie-foxx-changed-drastically-with-news-of-his-health-problems.jpg><p>“When you look at these stories now you can laugh, they’re hilarious. When you’re in the moment and it’s happening to you and you’re a teenager and everything feels like the end of the world,” she explained to New York Post. “It felt like the worst thing that could happen was him showing up at my soccer game in a tight leather jacket. ‘Gosh, why is he doing this?! Nothing could be worse than this!’“</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mike Tyson Gave Jamie Foxx A Standing Ovation For Performing This Risky Impression Of Him</a></span></p><p>While not much is known about Corinne's relationship with her mother, Connie Kline, it's quite probable that the two haven't had as many conflicts. Though the 29-year-old rarely discusses her mother in interviews, she has shared a few heartfelt tributes that hint at a strong bond with her.</p><p>"I could not be more honored to say that my mother served for the United States Air Force. She glows with pride and strength for her country & service," she shared on her Instagram in November 2014. "So proud of you, Mama #veteransday."</p><h2 id=jamie-foxx-and-corinne-foxx-made-a-sitcom-based-on-their-fraught-relationship>Jamie Foxx And Corinne Foxx Made A Sitcom Based On Their Fraught Relationship</h2><p>Fortunately, Corinne didn’t consider her dad’s antics cringe-worthy for too long. With her teenage years firmly in the rearview mirror, the now 29-year-old eventually started to warm up to Jamie Foxx's idiosyncratic, larger-than-life persona.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Now, I’m at the age where I can appreciate all of his quirks," she revealed to New York Post in 2021. “I definitely have a new perspective on all of his antics now.

Sometimes he goes to extreme lengths, but it’s all out of love,” she said. “I will give my dad so many props because even if he didn’t know how to talk to a teenage girl, he always tried. He always showed up. He always gave 100%. I feel like that is what fueled the embarrassing moments but also why we have such a strong relationship now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/corinne-and-jamie-foxx.jpg><p>Now closer than ever, the twosome even managed to secure a Netflix deal by pitching their tumultuous relationship as a premise for a sitcom.

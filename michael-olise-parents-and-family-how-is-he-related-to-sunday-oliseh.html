Parents’ Name & Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Olise is an English who was born to a Nigerian father named Vincent Olise and a French-Algerian mother.</p><p>The name of his mother is not revealed in the media, but Michael has portrayed her as a sweet, loving, and caring woman. He comes from a middle-class football-loving family. His parents were able to bring the best out of him despite not being among Hammersmith’s wealthiest residents.</p><p>His father loved football and tried to play professionally but couldn’t. He decided to fulfill his dream through them. Hence, the Nigerian promised to build a solid football foundation for Olise and his brother. His younger brother Richard joined Chelsea as an Under-9 and played for England in youth football.</p><p>Michael’s parents have been aware of his introverted personality since he was a little child. But they kept on supporting him throughout his journey. The player’s family used to be the ones who could relate to and support him in the circumstances. Fortunately, Olise found a way to channel some of his introversion through football. He became more social after playing the delightful game. However, he is still introverted and is quite private.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-michael-olise-related-to-sunday-oliseh-siblings-family></span>Is Michael Olise Related To Sunday Oliseh? Siblings & Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Former Nigerian footballer Sunday Oliseh is hailed as one of the greatest African midfielders of all time.</p><p>The former Super Eagles captain was renowned for his physical and technical prowess. He was able to play for renowned clubs like Ajax, Juventus, and Borussia Dortmund because of this opportunity. He received numerous accolades when he was a member of these teams, ensuring that history would record his name.</p><p>Many people assume that Michael and Sunday are related because of their common last names. Additionally, they both play the midfield position, which supports the claim even more. Despite everything, Sunday and Michael are unrelated. Their names are the only thing they have in common.</p><p>Like Sunday, Olise is qualified to represent France, Algeria, England, and Nigeria internationally. He was selected for the France U18 team on May 27, 2019, in time for the Toulon Tournament. On June 2, 2019, he played his first game against Qatar U23. Michael was listed as a standby for the Nigerian team participating in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Lesotho and Benin in March 2021. Olise made his debut for France’s under-21 team in the team’s 2-0 victory over the Faroe Islands under-21 in March 2022 after receiving his first call-up to the squad.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-olise-net-worth></span>Michael Olise Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;Globe Answer, Michael Olise has an estimated net worth of $500 thousand.</p><p>He was signed a five-year contract with Crystal Palace after activating the team’s £8.37 million release clause on July 8, 2021. He replaced Jordan Ayew in the 86th minute of Crystal Palace’s 3-0 victory over Tottenham on September 11, 2021, to make his Premier League debut for the team.</p><p>Olise made his official Crystal Palace debut on October 23, 2021, in a 1-1 home tie with Newcastle United.</p><p>Moreover, he is left-footed and can play either side of this position as a left or right-sided attacking mid. He is renowned for his quickness while playing passes that split up defenses. He has an excellent first impression and is well aware of his surroundings. He can frequently play behind the opposing defense or change the angle of attack thanks to his good passing range.</p><p>He prefers to operate on the right half-space, 50 to 30 yards from goal, where he has a variety of alternatives for carrying on the assault. Olise is a quick and dynamic player when he is on the ball. Even when he is dribbling in very small places or running while carrying the ball, he is capable of turning fast with good acceleration and change of pace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZmLWisctmpqWho5p6sa3RnqWtq12Wu6V5xZqkoqSpYrWww4yiqmaglWK%2FprjArZydZaSkerTBzZ2YsmWfoba0scdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mikayla-mccaughey-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mikayla McCaughey Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;

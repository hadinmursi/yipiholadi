The Tennessee-born crooner, who is the youngest member of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, has created a name for herself with her emotionally charged lyrics that practically every age group can relate to. She has consistently topped the charts, and it's unlikely that anyone hasn't heard at least one of her songs.</p><p>Although her songs cover a wide range of topics, Taylor’s fans enjoy the fact that she also writes about her well-known ex-boyfriends. She may not have a song for each one of her friends and exes— especially flings and short-term relationships — but fans can’t help but wonder if she has a song about her brief affair with Tom Hiddleston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she written in total?</span><p><strong>Updated December 2023:</strong>Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston have both moved on to other relationships. Hiddleston got engaged to Zawe Ashton in December 2023 and Swift has been dating Travis Kelce since July 2023. Swift and Kelce are doing well in their relationship, according to reports, <a href=#>because Kelce is not afraid of the limelight</a> like others Swift has been with. One such person was Hiddleston who, by some accounts had a hard time with the level of celebrity Swift had at the time, which has only grown since.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-taylor-swift-and-tom-hiddleston-rsquo-s-relationship>What Happened To Taylor Swift And Tom Hiddleston’s Relationship?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/this-is-how-taylor-swift-spends-her-billion-dollar-net-worth-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood actor Tom Hiddleston is one of the older men Taylor Swift has dated. In 2016, the singer and Tom connected at New York's glitzy Met Gala. On camera, the couple was seen dancing at the event. Taylor and renowned DJ Calvin Harris had just ended their relationship at that point. She was seen holding Tom's hand and kissing him on a beach two weeks after the breakup. The relationship seemed to be going well, and they were spotted together multiple times. At her Fourth of July party, Tom was photographed sporting the now-famous I adore TS T-shirt, and he even introduced her to his mother. Tom made the relationship public so fast that the media accused him of using the singer to gain fame.</p><p>However, the actor defended himself by saying, <strong>"The truth is Taylor and I are together. We’re very happy. Thanks for asking. That’s the truth. Not a publicity stunt."</strong></p><p>The couple’s love affair was very public, to the point that people started wondering if this was for PR purposes only. After only a few months of dating, their split was finally announced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When they broke up that September, Taylor's team said Tom demanded too much attention from the relationship. But according to others close to Tom, he simply became weary of the celebrity. Many felt that Taylor and Tom were <a href=#>really never meant to be</a>. And like most of the singer’s exes, it appears Tom got a mention in one of her songs.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:07</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar53281845.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Taylor Swift Spends Her Billion Dollar Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's net worth has reached billionaire status, and her spending habits are worth noting.</span><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-write-a-breakup-song-about-tom-hiddleston>Did Taylor Swift Write A Breakup Song About Tom Hiddleston?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg><p>Although Taylor never identifies the ex-lover a song is dedicated to, people enjoy doing their research and putting things together using context clues.</p><p>Swifties have long believed that the track <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Getaway Car" from her album, Reputation, in 2017 is about Tom Hiddleston</a>. In the song, Taylor talks about a relationship that she shouldn’t have gotten into so hastily, which sleuths think means Tom, and how she was “running away” from an ex, which is her referring to her former partner Calvin Harris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song reads, "Think about the place you first met me" and how "The ties were black, the lies were white", which is in reference to where Tom and Taylor meet at the Met Gala.</p><p>She also sings "It’s no surprise I turned you in/’Cause us traitors never win." This seems again to point to her being a traitor because she left Calvin for Tom and it didn’t work out.</p><p>One of the Swifties tweeted, "Getaway Car is such a jam and so brutally honest (poor Tom lmao) can’t stop listening."</p><p>Another wrote, "Listening to getaway car hm I’m broken because Tom Hiddleston didn’t deserve it… poor Tom."</p><p>A third fan gushed, "Is Taylor ready to talk about Tom Hiddleston in the Getaway Car TV music video? Like this is a heartbreaking story… poor friend was so in love with blondie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Tom Hiddleston seems like a perfectly nice guy but Getaway Car ended his career and made him look like the human embodiment of Boo Boo the Fool," yet another fan chimed in.

It looks like there’s no bad blood between them, after all.</p><p>Of course it was real," Tom explained. "Taylor is an amazing woman. She’s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time.
